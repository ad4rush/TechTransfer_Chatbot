[Image page_6_image_0.jpeg Analysis (by Gemini)]
Here is a thorough analysis of the image you provided:

**Visual Elements and Structure:**

*   **Diagram Type:** The image is a circuit diagram. Specifically, it depicts the schematic of a Transmission Gate Flip-Flop (TGFF).
*   **Components:** The diagram shows the following key components:
    *   **Clocking Circuit:** Two inverters connected in series at the top, labeled `CLK`, `CLKB`, and `CLKI`. `CLK` is the clock input. The inverters produce the inverted clock signal `CLKB`, and then inverting `CLKB` results in `CLKI`.
    *   **Master Latch:** A section enclosed in a dashed rectangle labeled "Master Latch". It consists of:
        *   A transmission gate controlled by `CLKI` and `CLKB`.
        *   Two CMOS inverters connected back-to-back to form a latch.
    *   **Slave Latch:** A section enclosed in a dashed rectangle labeled "Slave Latch". It mirrors the structure of the master latch.
        *   A transmission gate controlled by `CLKB` and `CLKI`.
        *   Two CMOS inverters connected back-to-back to form a latch.
    *   **Input/Output:** The input is labeled "D", and the output is labeled "Q".
    *   **Power:** `Vdd` and Ground symbols are present, indicating the power supply.

**Text within the Image:**

*   `CLK`: Clock Input
*   `CLKB`: Clock Bar (inverted clock signal)
*   `CLKI`: Clock Inverted (re-inverted clock signal)
*   `D`: Data Input
*   `Q`: Data Output
*   `Vdd`: Power Supply Voltage
*   "Master Latch": Label for the first latch stage.
*   "Slave Latch": Label for the second latch stage.

**Significance:**

*   The TGFF is a common type of flip-flop, which is a fundamental building block in digital circuits for storing binary data.
*   The master-slave configuration is used to prevent race conditions and ensure correct data transfer.
*   The transmission gates are used to control the flow of data into the latches.
*   The CMOS inverters provide the latching functionality, holding the data value until the next clock cycle.
*   The clocking scheme ensures that the master and slave latches are active on opposite phases of the clock.

**Context and Importance:**

The text on page 6, along with the surrounding pages, establishes the following context:

1.  **Sustainability Framework:** The paper is about validating a sustainability framework for foundation cell designs. This framework aims to consider not only performance and power (PPA) but also environmental impact.

2.  **Embodied Carbon Footprint (eCFP):** The paper is evaluating the eCFP of different flip-flop implementations, considering factors like area, extra metal usage, and additional processing steps.

3.  **TGFF as an Example:** The TGFF (the circuit in the image) is used as an example to illustrate the impact of layout optimization and metal layer usage on eCFP. The paper compares TGFF implementations using only Metal-1 (M1) versus using Metal-1 and Metal-2 (M2).

4.  **Metal Layer Impact:** The discussion revolves around whether using extra metal layers (like M2) in the layout reduces or increases the eCFP. A denser layout may reduce eCFP but using an additional metal layer may increase it.

Therefore, the image is important because it visually represents the TGFF circuit that is being analyzed in the context of the paper's sustainability framework. The paper uses the TGFF to show how design choices in foundation cells (like the layout using different metal layers) influence the overall environmental impact, measured by eCFP. This shows the importance of considering manufacturing impacts, in addition to power usage.

Here's an analysis of the image based on your instructions:

**Visual Elements and Structure:**

*   **Layout Diagram:** The image is a layout diagram of a circuit, presumably a Transmission Gate Flip-Flop (TGFF) based on the surrounding text. It shows the physical arrangement of different circuit elements in a 2D view.
*   **Color Coding:** The diagram uses color coding to differentiate between layers and materials. Based on the key, we see:
    *   Purple striped pattern: Metal 1 layer
    *   Red brick pattern: Polysilicon (Poly)
*   **Dimensions:** The image indicates dimensions in terms of "Tracks". The width is labeled as "22 Track" and the height as "26 Track".
*   **Labels:**  Within the diagram, there are labels identifying specific nodes or components, though the resolution makes them difficult to decipher completely. Noticeable labels include "vdd", "gnd", and partially readable labels near transistor gates. There are also small numerical values.
*   **Transistors:** The most visually prominent features are the transistor layouts, easily identifiable by the gate (red polysilicon) crossing the active area (within a rectangular green boundary in the Metal 1 layer). These are repeated and interconnected to implement the flip-flop's logic.

**Text within the Image:**

*   **"Metal 1" and "Poly":** Legend for material layers.
*   **"22 Track":** Width of the layout.
*   **"26 Track":** Height of the layout.
*   **"vdd":** Power supply voltage.
*   **"gnd":** Ground connection.
*   Numerical values are also displayed, presumably related to dimensions.

**Context and Importance:**

The image shows the layout of a TGFF, a type of flip-flop circuit. Based on the text from page 7 and surrounding pages, here's the significance:

*   **Embodied Carbon Footprint (eCFP) analysis:** The paper aims to develop a framework for evaluating the sustainability of foundation cell designs (like flip-flops). The layout and the materials used in its construction are key factors in determining the *embodied* carbon footprint (eCFP). A denser layout typically means less material is used and potentially a lower eCFP, however using more complex layering introduces additional process steps which contribute to a higher eCFP.
*   **Metal Layer Impact:**  The paper explores the impact of using additional metal layers (Metal 2, or M2) in addition to Metal 1 (M1) for routing within the cell.  The layout likely represents the TGFF implemented using only M1, or potentially a hybrid M1+M2 approach.  The image, along with other figures, demonstrates how using M2 can result in a smaller, denser layout (smaller area).
*   **Trade-offs:**  While using M2 can reduce area, the surrounding text explains there's a trade-off. It can increase congestion at the System-on-Chip (SoC) level, leading to a higher eCFP due to increased routing complexity during the chip integration phase.
*   **Optimization:** The layout is part of an optimization process to minimize eCFP. Different layout variations (using different numbers of M2 routing tracks) are compared.
*   **TGFF as Example:** The TGFF serves as a case study to illustrate the framework's ability to assess the impact of layout choices on sustainability.
*   **Foundation Cell Design:** This analysis is relevant to the design of foundation cells, basic building blocks used in digital circuits. Evaluating the carbon footprint early in the design process can lead to more sustainable overall system designs.
*   **Application Context:** The surrounding pages mention different application profiles (IoT, HPC, Automotive, Portable Electronics). The choice of layout (and the metal layer usage) can impact the power consumption and overall sustainability of the circuit, depending on its intended application and operational lifetime.

In summary, the image provides a visual representation of a key element in the paper's investigation: the layout of a TGFF. Its importance lies in illustrating how physical design choices directly affect the embodied carbon footprint of a circuit and showcasing the framework's ability to analyze these effects.



[Image page_7_image_1.png Analysis (by Gemini)]
Here's a breakdown of the image based on your instructions:

**Visual Elements and Structure:**

The image is a layout diagram of an integrated circuit (IC) component. It is a top-down view showing the various layers of the circuit. The legend at the top indicates three distinct materials used:

*   **Metal 1:** Represented by a purple/lavender hatched pattern.
*   **Metal 2:** Represented by a cyan/turquoise hatched pattern.
*   **Poly (Polysilicon):** Represented by a dark red hatched pattern.

The layout shows an arrangement of these materials in specific patterns to create transistors and interconnect them to form a functional circuit. The layout has a rectangular shape, and arrows with text indicate the dimensions of the layout: 21 Tracks (horizontal) and 26 Tracks (vertical).

**Text Within the Image:**

*   **Legend:** "Metal 1," "Metal 2," "Poly."
*   **Dimensions:** "21 Track," "26 Track."
*   **Labels within the layout:** You can see the labels “Vdd,” “Gnd,” and “ck”.

**Context and Importance:**

The image is Figure 4 from the research paper. Based on the surrounding text, this figure likely shows the layout of a "Change Sensing Flipflop (CSFF)." The text mentions designing different layout variations of this flip-flop using different numbers of M2 routing tracks: CSFF(M1+1M2), CSFF(M1+2M2), and CSFF(M1+3M2).

Based on the text, it is likely that this is the layout of the CSFF(M1+1M2) flip-flop, and that these different layout variations are designed to evaluate the impact of using additional metal layers (M2) on the embodied carbon footprint (eCFP).

The paper discusses how using higher metal layers (like M2) can reduce the area of the cell but can also increase SoC-level congestion, potentially increasing eCFP. The goal is to find a balance that minimizes the overall carbon footprint. The text mentions that using one track of M2 reduces the flip-flop area and lowers the eCFP compared to an M1-only implementation.

**Overall Importance:**

The image is important because it visually represents the design choices being made to optimize the circuit for both performance (area) and sustainability (eCFP). By comparing the different CSFF layouts with varying M2 tracks, the researchers aim to determine the optimal design for minimizing environmental impact. The figure provides a visual component that grounds the more abstract discussion of carbon footprint and design trade-offs.



[Image page_7_image_2.png Analysis (by Gemini)]
Here's a detailed analysis of the image based on your instructions:

**1. Visual Elements and Structure:**

*   **Type:** The image is a bar graph.
*   **Structure:** The graph has two sections, each representing a different metric: "Area" and "Embodied Footprint". For each metric, there are two bars, one for TGFF(M1) and another for TGFF(M1 + 1M2).
*   **Axes:**
    *   The left y-axis represents "Area" in µm².
    *   The right y-axis represents "Embodied Footprint" in mWh.
    *   The x-axis represents "Metric", with labels for "Area" and "Embodied Footprint".
*   **Bars:** The bars are color-coded and patterned for differentiation:
    *   TGFF(M1): Orange with diagonal lines
    *   TGFF(M1 + 1M2): Yellowish-orange with dotted pattern
    *   The Embodied Footprint has the same pattern, but with the color light-blue

**2. Text within the Image:**

*   **Title/Legend:**
    *   TGFF (M1) - Top right above area
    *   TGFF (M1 + 1M2) - Top right above are
*   **Axis Labels:**
    *   Area (µm²)
    *   Embodied Footprint (mWh)
    *   Metric
*   **Data Point Labels:**
    *   Area: 22.9, 21.8
    *   Embodied Footprint: 1.36, 1.3

**3. Image Context and Significance (Based on Provided Text):**

*   **Overall Context:** The image (Fig. 3 in the paper) is part of a study that evaluates a "sustainability framework" for foundation cell designs in integrated circuits. Specifically, it illustrates the impact of using an additional metal routing layer (M2) in designing a Transmission Gate Flipflop (TGFF). The aim is to analyze how layout efficiency (through the use of M2) affects both the area and the embodied carbon footprint (eCFP).

*   **Importance/Findings:**

    *   The text indicates that using M2 in the TGFF layout (TGFF(M1+1M2)) results in a slightly smaller area compared to using only M1 (TGFF(M1)).  The graph confirms this, showing a reduction from 22.9 µm² to 21.8 µm².
    *   The text also highlights that the use of M2 reduces the eCFP. The graph visually supports this, with the eCFP decreasing from 1.36 mWh to 1.3 mWh.

*   **Broader Significance:** The image is used to validate the sustainability framework's ability to capture the trade-offs between area and eCFP when different layout techniques are used. While smaller area is generally desirable, the framework aims to account for the broader environmental impact, including the energy and materials used in manufacturing. The text explains that even though using an additional metal layer might initially seem like a positive change (due to area reduction), it can potentially increase system-level congestion, which the framework is designed to consider. The results shown in the figure suggest that, in this specific case, the benefit of reduced area outweighs the potential increase in congestion.

**In summary:** The image visually represents the trade-off between area and embodied footprint for two different layouts of a TGFF, one using only metal layer 1 (M1) and the other using M1 with an additional routing track of metal layer 2 (M2). The results, depicted in the graph, show that using M2 slightly reduces both area and embodied footprint. The figure's significance lies in its contribution to validating a sustainability framework for foundation cell designs.



[Image page_7_image_3.png Analysis (by Gemini)]
Here's a thorough analysis of the image based on the provided context:

**Image Description:**

The image is a bar graph comparing the area and embodied footprint (eCFP) of different versions of a Change Sensing Flipflop (CSFF). The x-axis is labeled "Metric" and shows two categories: "Area" and "Embodied Footprint". The left y-axis is labeled "Area (µm²)", and the right y-axis is labeled "Embodied Footprint (mWh)".

There are three versions of the CSFF being compared, differentiated by the number of metal routing tracks used in their layout:
1.  CSFF(M1+1M2)
2.  CSFF(M1+2M2)
3.  CSFF(M1+3M2)

Each version has a bar for "Area" (in orange) and a bar for "Embodied Footprint" (in light blue). The bars are patterned to distinguish them:

*   CSFF(M1+1M2) has diagonal stripes.
*   CSFF(M1+2M2) has circles.
*   CSFF(M1+3M2) has stars.

Data values are printed above each bar.

**Text within the Image:**

*   **X-axis:** "Metric", "Area", "Embodied Footprint"
*   **Y-axes:** "Area (µm²)", "Embodied Footprint (mWh)"
*   **Legend:** "CSFF(M1+1M2)", "CSFF(M1+2M2)", "CSFF(M1+3M2)"
*   **Data values (Area):** 16.6, 16.6, 15.1
*   **Data values (Embodied Footprint):** 1.01, 1.04, 0.978

**Structure:**

The graph is a standard bar chart, designed for easy comparison of discrete data points. The use of two y-axes allows for displaying area and embodied footprint, which have different units, on the same plot. The patterning and legend clearly identify the different versions of the flipflop.

**Significance:**

The graph illustrates the impact of using different numbers of metal routing tracks (specifically Metal-2 or M2) in the layout of a CSFF on its area and embodied footprint.

**Context and Importance:**

Based on the surrounding text from page 7, the purpose of this graph (Fig. 4) is to support the argument that simply using more metal layers in cell layout does *not* automatically reduce the embodied carbon footprint (eCFP). The authors designed and implemented different layout versions of a Change Sensing Flipflop (CSFF) using varying numbers of M2 routing tracks, in addition to Metal-1 (M1).

The text states that while adding M2 tracks can sometimes *reduce* the area of the cell (and therefore potentially the eCFP), it can also increase congestion at the system-on-chip (SoC) level, leading to a *larger* eCFP.  The graph visually shows that CSFF(M1+3M2) has the smallest area (15.1 µm²), but CSFF(M1+2M2) has the largest embodied footprint (1.04 mWh), indicating that using two M2 tracks is less efficient in overall layout.

The surrounding text also provides the following crucial context:

*   CSFF is a low-power flipflop architecture used in IoT applications.
*   The study aims to validate a sustainability framework for foundation cell designs.
*   They are evaluating the impact of layout efficiency and extra metal on sustainability.

**In summary, this image is important because it provides visual evidence to support the paper's argument that the relationship between layout choices (number of metal layers) and environmental impact (eCFP) is not straightforward. It shows that while using more metal layers can reduce area, it may not always lead to a lower embodied carbon footprint due to factors like increased congestion at the SoC level.**

Here's a thorough analysis of the image, incorporating the surrounding text and focusing on its context and significance within the research paper:

**Image Description**

The image (Fig. 5) is a bar graph comparing two flip-flop designs, "SETU FF" and "RAV FF", based on two metrics: "Area (µm²)" and "Embodied Footprint (mWh)".

*   **Visual Elements:**
    *   Two sets of paired bars. Each pair represents one metric (Area, Embodied Footprint) and compares SETU FF and RAV FF for that metric.
    *   The bar for SETU FF has a diagonal hatch pattern, while the bar for RAV FF has a pattern of small circles.
    *   Values are displayed above each bar, indicating the specific measurement for that metric and design.
    *   There are two y-axis, one each for the area and the embodied footprint.
    *   Each bar has a black border.
    *   The color of SETU FF bars are orange and light blue. The color of RAV FF bars is orange and light blue

*   **Text Elements:**
    *   X-axis label: "Metric"
    *   X-axis ticks: "Area", "Embodied Footprint"
    *   Y-axis label (left): "Area (µm²)"
    *   Y-axis label (right): "Embodied Footprint (mWh)"
    *   Legend: "SETU FF", "RAV FF"
    *   Values above bars: "84", "72.8" for Area; "6.5", "6.67" for Embodied Footprint.

**Data Interpretation and Significance**

*   **Area:** SETU FF has a larger area (84 µm²) than RAV FF (72.8 µm²).
*   **Embodied Footprint:** RAV FF has a slightly larger embodied footprint (6.67 mWh) than SETU FF (6.5 mWh).

**Context and Importance**

The research paper aims to provide a framework for evaluating the sustainability of different hardware designs by considering both operational and embodied carbon footprints. The image illustrates how this framework can be used to compare two flip-flop designs, SETU FF and RAV FF.

*   **Page Text Context:**
    *   The text mentions that RAV FF uses trench capacitors, which leads to higher manufacturing emissions. This contributes to its larger embodied footprint.
    *   The text states that the framework considers this and assesses that the eCFP of RAV FF is larger, as shown in Fig 5.

*   **Surrounding Text Context:**
    *   Page 6 mentions: "Using a trench capacitor results in increased processing steps for RAV FF."
    *   Page 6: "RAVFF is denser than SETUFF because it usestrench capacitance.However,duetoadditionalprocessingsteps required to manufacture a chip with RAV FF, its eCFP is larger than that of SETU FF."

**Overall Significance**

The image and the surrounding text emphasize that a smaller area (as seen with RAV FF) doesn't necessarily translate to a lower environmental impact. The additional processing steps needed to create the trench capacitors in RAV FF outweigh the area benefit in terms of embodied footprint. This highlights the importance of considering the entire life cycle and manufacturing processes of a hardware component when assessing its sustainability. The framework presented in the paper aims to facilitate this comprehensive assessment.

The figure provides a specific example that a designer can use to understand the trade-offs between different design choices and their impact on overall sustainability. This is crucial for making informed decisions in creating more environmentally friendly hardware.



[Image page_8_image_1.png Analysis (by Gemini)]
Here's a thorough analysis of the image, based on the provided text and the surrounding context:

**Image Description**

The image (identified as Fig. 6 in the text) is a bar graph comparing the operational carbon footprint (oCFP) of two approximate adder architectures: AMA1 (Approximate Mirror Adder 1) and LCAFA3 (Low-Cost Approximate Full Adder 3).

*   **Type:** Bar graph
*   **X-axis:** Applications (IoT, HPC, PE, Auto)
*   **Y-axis:** Footprint (mWh) - note the logarithmic scale
*   **Bars:** Two bars for each application, representing the oCFP of AMA1 and LCAFA3. LCAFA3 is represented by diagonal lines and AMA1 is represented by dots.
*   **Data Labels:** Numerical values are displayed above each bar, indicating the specific oCFP values in mWh.

**Text within the Image:**

*   **Title:** None visible, but the caption is "Comparison of operational carbon footprint (oCFP) of approximate adders for different application profiles. AMA1 has smallest oCFP for IoT application, while LCAFA3 is more suitable for other applications."
*   **Axis Labels:** "Footprint (mWh)" on the y-axis, "Applications" on the x-axis.
*   **Application Labels:** "IoT", "HPC", "PE", "Auto"
*   **Legend:** "LCAFA3", "AMA1" with their respective patterns.
*   **Data Values:** 1.35 (LCAFA3, IoT), 0.978 (AMA1, IoT), 25.6 (LCAFA3, HPC), 69.3 (AMA1, HPC), 5.48 (LCAFA3, PE), 9.34 (AMA1, PE), 3.03 (LCAFA3, Auto), 33.0 (AMA1, Auto)

**Analysis and Significance**

The image is crucial to understanding the core findings of this section of the research paper.  The paper is investigating a framework to evaluate the *sustainability* of different hardware designs by measuring operational carbon footprint (oCFP).

*   **Context from Text:** The surrounding text explains that AMA1 is a low-leakage design, while LCAFA3 consumes less power per computation. The graph visually compares these two designs across four different application profiles: IoT, HPC (High-Performance Computing), PE (Presumably, processing element), and Auto (Automotive).
*   **Key Observation:** The graph clearly shows that for IoT applications, AMA1 has a significantly *lower* oCFP than LCAFA3.  However, for HPC, PE, and Auto applications, LCAFA3 exhibits a lower oCFP.  This is also explicitly stated in the figure caption.
*   **Importance and Interpretation:** This visual representation supports the authors' argument that the optimal choice of hardware design (in this case, an approximate adder) is *dependent on the intended application*. A design optimized for one use case (e.g., IoT) may not be the most sustainable choice for another (e.g., HPC).  The graph quantifies this difference, making it easy to see the magnitude of the oCFP variation across application profiles.
*   **Logarithmic Scale Significance:** The logarithmic scale on the y-axis is important because it allows for the visualization of a wide range of oCFP values. The differences in oCFP between AMA1 and LCAFA3 in HPC are much larger, and the log scale helps make the differences in smaller numbers, like in IoT, visible.

**Summary**

Fig. 6 effectively illustrates that the optimal selection between the AMA1 and LCAFA3 approximate adder architectures hinges on the intended application profile. AMA1 is preferable for IoT applications due to its lower oCFP, while LCAFA3 is more suitable for HPC, PE, and automotive applications from a sustainability perspective. This highlights the importance of considering application-specific factors when evaluating the environmental impact of hardware designs.

The profiles consider variations in operating time ratios and product lifespan, factors directly influencing oCFP (as indicated by Equation 6, mentioned on page 8).
*   **Findings (Based on the Image and Text):**
    *   For IoT applications, DSELS has a significantly lower oCFP (0.04 mWh) than RSWCRLS (0.08 mWh).
    *   However, for HPC, PE, and Auto applications, RSWCRLS has a lower oCFP than DSELS. The oCFP is much higher for HPC than PE and Auto for both the designs. The difference between DSELS and RSWCRLS is significant for HPC compared to PE and Auto.
    *   The surrounding text emphasizes that while DSELS is better for IoT due to its low power consumption, RSWCRLS might be a more sustainable choice if the product is also used in other applications, even sporadically. The image data supports this conclusion.

**Importance:**

The image is important because it visually demonstrates the paper's key finding: the optimal hardware design for sustainability depends heavily on the intended application profile. While a design might be best for a specific use case (e.g., DSELS in IoT), it may not be the best choice for broader applications. This underscores the importance of considering the entire lifecycle and operating conditions when designing for sustainability. This reinforces the claim in the paper that the proposed framework can compare different designs for their operational footprint in different usecases and design profiles.

Here's a detailed analysis of the image based on the provided text and the image itself:

**Visual Elements and Structure**

The image is a bar graph comparing the operational carbon footprint (oCFP) of two flip-flop designs: CSFF (Change Sensing Flip-Flop) and C2SFF (Contention-free Change Sensing Flip-Flop).

*   **Type:** Bar graph
*   **Axes:**
    *   X-axis: "Activity Factor (%) | Frequency (MHz)". Two data points are shown: "10 | 100" (representing 10% activity factor and 100 MHz frequency) and "50 | 400" (representing 50% activity factor and 400 MHz frequency).
    *   Y-axis: "Footprint (mWh)", ranging from 0.0 to 2.5 mWh.
*   **Bars:** Each data point on the x-axis has two bars, one for CSFF and one for C2SFF, representing their oCFP values. The CSFF bars are distinguished by diagonal hatching, and the C2SFF bars are distinguished by a dot pattern inside.
*   **Values:** Numerical values are displayed above each bar, indicating the precise oCFP for each design under each condition.
*   **Legend:** The graph includes a legend at the top right to differentiate between the CSFF and C2SFF bar representations.

**Text within the Image**

*   **Axis Labels:**
    *   X-axis: "Activity Factor (%) | Frequency (MHz)"
    *   Y-axis: "Footprint (mWh)"
*   **Data Point Labels:**

    *   "50 | 400"
*   **Bar Values:**
    *   CSFF (10% | 100MHz): 0.14
    *   C2SFF (10% | 100MHz): 0.527
    *   CSFF (50% | 400MHz): 2.41
    *   C2SFF (50% | 400MHz): 2.17
*   **Legend Labels:**
    *   CSFF
    *   C2SFF

**Context and Importance**

*   **Overall Context:** The image is part of a research paper focused on developing a sustainability framework for evaluating foundation cell libraries in VLSI design. The goal is to incorporate environmental impact assessments (specifically, carbon footprint) into the design process, enabling more sustainable design choices.
*   **Specific Context (Page 9):**  The image (Fig. 9) specifically visualizes the operational carbon footprint (oCFP) comparison between CSFF and C2SFF flip-flops under different switching activity (α) and frequency (f) conditions.
*   **Importance:**
    *   **Illustrates Impact of α and f:** The graph clearly demonstrates that the oCFP of both flip-flops is heavily influenced by the switching activity and frequency.
    *   **Design Choice Dependence:** The image and accompanying text emphasize that the *optimal choice of flip-flop design is application-dependent*. Specifically, at low activity and frequency (10% & 100MHz), CSFF has a significantly lower oCFP (0.14 mWh) than C2SFF (0.527 mWh), making it a more sustainable choice for low-power applications like IoT. However, as activity and frequency increase (50% & 400MHz), the difference narrows, with C2SFF showing a slightly lower oCFP than CSFF. In scenarios where switching activity and operating frequency are high, dynamic power becomes the dominant factor influencing sustainability. The C2SFF architecture has lower dynamic power, making it a more sustainable design option.
    *   **Validates the Framework:** The figure and associated discussion demonstrate the framework's ability to capture the trade-offs between different design parameters (like power, frequency, and switching activity) and their impact on environmental sustainability. The framework can provide insights not easily gleaned from traditional power/performance/area (PPA) metrics alone.
*   **Relationship to Surrounding Text:** The text surrounding the image provides the explanation and context for the results. It discusses the impact of operating frequency on the oCFP of the approximate adders AMA1 and LCAFA3. At low frequencies, AMA1 has better oCFP, while at high frequencies, LCAFA3 is more suitable. The subsequent paragraph discusses the impact of leakage power on oCFP.
*   **Relevance to Total Carbon Footprint:** Fig. 9 is later used in the discussion of *total* carbon footprint (consolidating both embodied and operational carbon footprints), demonstrating how the oCFP analysis (as visualized in this image) affects the overall sustainability assessment. As mentioned in the text from page 9, "...when the oCFP of the two designs (for 10% switching activity and 100MHz frequency usage) is also taken into account (as shown in Fig. 9), CSFF emerges as a more sustainable choice."



[Image page_9_image_1.png Analysis (by Gemini)]
Here's a thorough analysis of the image based on the provided text and the image itself:

**Visual Elements and Structure:**

*   **Type:** The image is a bar graph (or technically a stacked bar graph) used to compare the "Total Footprint (mWh)" of different design implementations.

*   **X-axis:** Labeled as "Designs," the x-axis displays categorical labels representing different foundational cell designs. These include:
    *   TGFF(M1)
    *   TGFF(M1+1M2)
    *   DSELS
    *   RSWCRLS
    *   CSFF
    *   C2SFF

*   **Y-axis:** Labeled as "Total Footprint (mWh)", the y-axis represents the total carbon footprint measured in milliWatt-hours. It ranges from 0 to 2.5 mWh.

*   **Bars:** Each design has a bar that is divided into two stacked sections:
    *   **Bottom Section:** Light blue with diagonal hatching, representing the "Embodied" carbon footprint (eCFP).
    *   **Top Section:** Light green with a dotted pattern, representing the "Operational" carbon footprint (oCFP).

*   **Data Labels:** Each bar has a numeric label at the top representing the *total* carbon footprint for that design (the sum of embodied and operational).

*   **Legend:** In the top right corner of the graph, the legend specifies that the light blue, hatched section represents "Embodied" carbon footprint, and the green, dotted section represents "Operational" carbon footprint.

**Text within the Image:**

*   **Axis Labels:** "Designs" (x-axis) and "Total Footprint (mWh)" (y-axis).
*   **Design Labels:** TGFF(M1), TGFF(M1+1M2), DSELS, RSWCRLS, CSFF, C2SFF.
*   **Legend Labels:** "Embodied" and "Operational".
*   **Data Labels:** 1.97, 2.13, 0.88, 0.81, 1.11, 1.49 (representing the total footprint values for each design).

**Significance and Context:**

Based on the surrounding text, the image (Fig. 10) is crucial for illustrating the overall carbon footprint assessment of different foundational cell designs. Here's a breakdown of its importance:

1.  **Consolidated Footprint:** The figure consolidates the embodied carbon footprint (eCFP) and operational carbon footprint (oCFP) to provide a *total* carbon footprint metric for the evaluated designs.  Previous figures and sections of the paper examined eCFP and oCFP separately. This figure combines these factors.

2.  **Design Comparison:** It allows for a direct comparison of the sustainability of different design options, considering both the manufacturing and operational phases.

3.  **Counterintuitive Findings:** The text emphasizes that analyzing only one type of carbon footprint (either eCFP or oCFP) or using traditional Power, Performance, and Area (PPA) metrics can lead to *less* sustainable choices. The figure supports this by showing cases where a design with a lower eCFP might have a higher total footprint when the oCFP is considered, or vice-versa. For example:

    *   TGFF(M1) has a lower total footprint than TGFF(M1+1M2), even though TGFF(M1+1M2) was initially favored due to lower *eCFP* (as seen in Fig. 3).
    *   RSWCRLS has a lower total footprint than DSELS, even though DSELS has a lower *oCFP* (as seen in Fig. 7).

4.  **Demonstration of Framework Value:**  The figure demonstrates the value of the authors' proposed framework in combining eCFP and oCFP for more informed, sustainability-aware design decisions. It shows that a holistic approach is necessary.

5.  **Impact of Design Choices:** The comparison between CSFF and C2SFF reinforces the importance of considering the application profile (switching activity and operating frequency). This ties back to Fig. 9, where the oCFP of these designs was analyzed under different conditions.

**Overall Importance:**

Fig. 10 is a key result in the paper. It visually and quantitatively demonstrates the need for a comprehensive sustainability assessment framework that considers *both* embodied and operational carbon footprints. It reveals that focusing solely on traditional performance metrics or individual carbon footprint components can be misleading when making design choices for sustainable VLSI circuits. The findings encourage designers to use the proposed framework to make more informed and environmentally responsible decisions.



[Image page_9_image_2.png Analysis (by Gemini)]
Here is a detailed analysis of the provided image and its context:

**Visual Elements and Structure:**

*   **Type:** Bar graph
*   **X-axis:** Frequency (MHz), with two data points: 500 MHz and 3000 MHz.
*   **Y-axis:** Footprint (mWh) - Represents the operational carbon footprint (oCFP).  The scale ranges from 0.0 to 2.5 mWh.
*   **Bars:** There are two bars for each frequency, representing two different Approximate Adder architectures:
    *   LCAFA3 (Low-Cost Approximate Full Adder 3): Indicated by diagonal lines inside bar
    *   AMA1 (Approximate Mirror Adder 1): Indicated by dots inside bar
*   **Data Labels:** Each bar has a numerical label indicating its height (the oCFP value in mWh).

**Text within the Image:**

*   "Footprint (mWh)" - Y-axis label.
*   "Frequency (MHz)" - X-axis label.
*   "LCAFA3" - Legend, represents the Low-Cost Approximate Full Adder 3,
*   "AMA1" - Legend, represents the Approximate Mirror Adder 1.
*   "500" - X-axis tick label.
*   "3000" - X-axis tick label.
*   "1.35" - Data label for LCAFA3 at 500MHz.
*   "0.978" - Data label for AMA1 at 500MHz.
*   "1.4" - Data label for LCAFA3 at 3000MHz.
*   "2.52" - Data label for AMA1 at 3000MHz.

**Significance of Visual Elements and Data:**

*   The graph illustrates the oCFP of two different approximate adder architectures (LCAFA3 and AMA1) at two different operating frequencies (500 MHz and 3000 MHz).
*   At 500 MHz, AMA1 has a smaller oCFP (0.978 mWh) than LCAFA3 (1.35 mWh).
*   At 3000 MHz, LCAFA3 has a smaller oCFP (1.4 mWh) than AMA1 (2.52 mWh).
*   The graph visually demonstrates that the optimal choice between AMA1 and LCAFA3 depends on the operating frequency.

**Overall Context and Importance:**

The image (Fig. 8) comes from a research paper focused on developing a framework for evaluating the sustainability of VLSI (Very-Large-Scale Integration) designs, specifically at the foundation cell level. The paper aims to move beyond traditional Power, Performance, and Area (PPA) metrics to include environmental impact in design decisions.

The context provided explains that the researchers implemented and analyzed the LCAFA3 and AMA1 approximate adder architectures to compare their oCFP. The surrounding text emphasizes that:

*   AMA1 has lower leakage, while LCAFA3 consumes less power per computation.
*   At low frequencies, AMA1 is more sustainable.
*   At high frequencies, LCAFA3 is more sustainable.

The graph directly supports these claims by visually showing the differences in oCFP between the two architectures at different frequencies.  The data shows that while AMA1 is better at 500 MHz, LCAFA3 becomes significantly more efficient from a sustainability perspective at 3000 MHz.

**Importance:**

The image is important because it provides concrete evidence for the paper's argument that operating frequency significantly impacts the sustainability of different designs. This reinforces the need for a comprehensive sustainability framework that considers factors beyond just power consumption and area. The visual representation allows for easy comparison and understanding of the trade-offs involved in choosing between different approximate adder architectures for different applications. It highlights that a design choice that is optimal for one frequency may not be optimal for another, underscoring the importance of considering the intended use case.
