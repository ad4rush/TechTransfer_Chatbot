Abstract
The Creativity, Innovation, and Inventive Problem Solving (CIIPS) course serves as a cornerstone
for fostering creative thinking, systematic innovation, and entrepreneurial skills among students.
Through a structured curriculum integrating brainstorming methods, problem modeling, and
solution evaluation techniques, the course aims to equip students with tools to address complex
challenges and drive innovation. However, the evolving nature of the course, coupled with its
diverse methodologies, necessitates a thorough evaluation to understand its impact and identify
areas for improvement.
Building upon the foundational work from the previous semester, this project not only
investigates the effectiveness of the CIIPS course in enhancing creativity and problem-solving
abilities but also actively contributes to its development through practical experimentation and
technological integration. Last semester, we conducted an in-depth study analyzing the course's
long-term relevance, the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical application, and the
influence of different course iterations on student engagement and outcomes.
Expanding on this, we have begun drafting a research paper targeting the IEEE Education
Society, aiming to document our findings and contributions related to the CIIPS course. The
paper explores how creativity and structured innovation techniques taught in the course influence
students’ long-term academic and professional growth. We're currently framing it around three
core research questions: how effectively students retain and apply these techniques over time,
how different iterations of the course (such as patent-focused, socio-economic, or technical
problem-solving approaches) impact engagement and skill development, and how the course can
be redesigned to better support the generation of novel or patentable ideas. Alongside this, we’re
exploring educational design principles, common creativity barriers like psychological inertia,
and the broader pedagogical impact of embedding patent-based challenges into the curriculum.
In a parallel but closely related initiative, we fine-tuned a large language model (LLM) to assist
with the ideation process by automating the extraction of functional models from patent
documents. This effort involved a deep dive into understanding patent structures and
problem-solution mappings, curating a specialized dataset from diverse patents, and training the
model to output structured functional models from raw patent text. This tool is intended to
support students in generating novel and potentially patentable solutions, bridging the gap
between idea generation and technical execution.

Together, these efforts aim to transform the CIIPS course into a more dynamic,
technology-enhanced, and impactful learning experience. By addressing key challenges in
creativity education and leveraging AI for inventive problem solving, this project aspires to
empower students with the mindset and tools required for tackling real-world problems and
contributing meaningfully to industry and society.

Here is an analysis of the image, incorporating the surrounding text for context:

**Image Analysis:**

*   **Type:** Horizontal Bar Chart
*   **Purpose:** The chart visualizes the percentage of responses regarding possible reasons for the lack of concept usage following a course or training. The question posed is, "It is possible that none of the concepts were used? If so, what could be the possible reasons?".
*   **Structure:** The chart has the "Possible Reasons for Lack of Concept Usage" listed vertically on the y-axis, and the "Percentage of Responses" displayed horizontally on the x-axis ranging from 0% to 30%. Each reason is represented by a horizontal bar, with the length of the bar corresponding to the percentage of respondents who selected that reason. The bars are colored with varying shades of green, potentially indicating relative importance (darker = more frequent).
*   **Text and Labels:**
    *   **Title:** "It is possible that none of the concepts were used? If so, what could be the possible reasons?"
    *   **Y-axis Label:** "Possible Reasons for Lack of Concept Usage"
    *   **X-axis Label:** "Percentage of Responses"
    *   **Y-axis Categories (Reasons):**
        *   "Each firm has their own strategies/processes to tackle problems and they might expect those frameworks to be followed instead"
        *   "Prefer other methods" (appears twice)
        *   "Question not clear"
        *   "I faced less complex problem that can easily be solved through brainstorming"
        *   "They were used"
        *   "Lack of confidence in using them" (appears twice)
        *   "Difficulty remembering the specifics" (appears twice)
        *   "They are not applicable to my role"
    *   **Data Labels (Percentages):** 1.89%, 3.77%, 9.43%, 18.87%, 22.64%, 26.42%

**Significance and Context:**

The text from page 20 focuses on challenges in knowledge retention. The chart directly supports this point by illustrating the reasons why the course concepts might not be used after the training. The most prevalent reasons, as indicated by the chart, are that the concepts are "not applicable" to the role of the participants (26.42%) followed by "difficulty remembering the specifics" (22.64% and 18.87% of respondents).

Given the surrounding text, the image emphasizes the need to improve knowledge retention through more practical examples, case studies, and refresher materials. The chart reinforces the fact that a significant portion of the participants struggle with remembering specifics, which directly aligns with the suggestions offered to address these gaps.

Furthermore, the fact that concepts are perceived as "not applicable" suggests a need to either better tailor the course content to the participants' roles or to better demonstrate the applicability of the concepts across a wider range of scenarios. The relatively high percentage associated with "lack of confidence" (9.43% and 9.43% of respondents) also implies a need for more hands-on practice and support.

The additional suggestions from the surrounding pages, such as post-course workshops and alumni groups, are directly relevant to sustaining learning and addressing the retention challenges highlighted by the chart. Also "Expanding the course to include More Practical activities in class that require them to think end to end solutions for creative problem-solving and organizing innovation labs or hackathons were highly recommended." would probably alleviate the "lack of confidence" answers.

**Overall Importance:**

The image is crucial because it provides a visual representation of the key barriers to concept usage after the course. It directly connects the issues of retention and relevance to concrete feedback from the participants. It highlights the fact that despite the positive feedback on the course balancing theory and practice (83.8%), there are still significant challenges in translating the learned concepts into actual application. Therefore, the image justifies the need for the recommended improvements, such as integrating more real-world examples, offering refresher materials, providing post-course support, and optional certifications.

Here's a breakdown of the image analysis:

**Visual Elements and Structure:**

*   **Type:** The image is a pie chart.
*   **Structure:** The pie chart is divided into two segments representing the responses to a question about the perceived benefit of receiving a formal TRIZ certification.
*   The larger segment (blue) represents "Yes" responses.
*   The smaller segment (orange) represents "No" responses.
*   A legend to the right indicates which color corresponds to "Yes" and "No" responses.
*   The percentages are displayed within each segment.

**Text Within the Image:**

*   **Title:** "Do you think receiving a formal TRIZ certification upon completing this course would benefit you? (Certification charges are upwards of INR 8000)"
*   **Labels:** "Yes," "No"
*   **Data Points:** "64.3%" (Yes), "35.7%" (No)
*   **Legend:** "Responses" (with labels) "Yes," "No"

**Overall Context and Importance:**

The pie chart visually represents survey data regarding participants' perception of the value of obtaining a formal TRIZ certification after completing a course. The text on the page and surrounding pages supports this.

*   **Connection to Page Text:** The page text specifically mentions "Certification Preferences," stating that a majority (64.9%) did *not* perceive value in obtaining certification, while 35.1% expressed interest. The pie chart displays the percentage of people who believe certification would benefit them, with 64.3% saying "Yes" and 35.7% saying "No." This result is conflicting with the written text. Note that the text refers to if people believe there is *value* while the image shows the response to *benefit*, but the main concern is that the values in the pie chart and written text are swapped.
*   **Importance:** This chart is important because it provides quantitative data regarding participant attitudes toward formal certification and its cost in Indian Rupees (INR). It helps the researchers understand the needs and priorities of the course participants and make informed decisions about offering certification as an option.
*   **Broader Context:** Combined with the surrounding text regarding participant motivation for innovation and patent filing, the data on certification preference can guide decisions about resource allocation and how to best support the long-term application of TRIZ principles by participants. If cost is a concern, potentially offering subsidized or optional certifications could be considered, which is actually mentioned in the text.

In conclusion, the pie chart offers a clear and concise visual representation of participant preferences regarding TRIZ certification. It complements the surrounding text and provides valuable insights into potential future steps for course design and delivery.

    *   **Y-axis:** Lists "Student Categories."
    *   **Bars:** Three horizontal bars, each representing a student category. The length of each bar corresponds to the percentage of students in that category.
    *   **Colors:** The bars are colored differently:
        *   "Moderately Motivated Students" is salmon/coral.
        *   "Highly Motivated Students" is light green.
        *   "Actually Filed Patent" is light blue.
*   **Labels:**
    *   **Title:** "Motivation Levels Among Students"
    *   **Y-axis labels:** "Moderately Motivated Students," "Highly Motivated Students," "Actually Filed Patent."
    *   **Data labels:** Numerical values (percentages) displayed next to each bar (58.33, 33.33, 8.33).

**Text Within the Image:**

*   **Title:** "Motivation Levels Among Students"
*   **Axis Labels:** "Student Categories", "Percentage of Students"
*   **Category Labels:** "Moderately Motivated Students," "Highly Motivated Students," "Actually Filed Patent."
*   **Data Values:** "58.33", "33.33", "8.33"

**Interpretation and Significance:**

The bar chart visually represents the levels of motivation among students, specifically concerning patent filing. It shows the following:

*   **Most students are moderately motivated:** A substantial 58.33% are classified as "Moderately Motivated Students."
*   **A significant portion is highly motivated:** 33.33% are categorized as "Highly Motivated Students."
*   **Few actually filed patents:** A small percentage (8.33%) "Actually Filed Patent."

**Context and Importance:**

Based on the surrounding text, here's the image's likely context and importance:

*   **TRIZ Course Evaluation:** The surrounding text discusses feedback on a TRIZ (Theory of Inventive Problem Solving) course or workshop.
*   **Patent Filing Encouragement:** The text explicitly mentions the course's aim to encourage patent filing and innovation.
*   **Batch-wise Findings (2021):**  The image likely depicts data from the 2021 batch of participants.
*   **Motivation vs. Execution Gap:**  The text mentions that while 58% of participants felt motivated to pursue patents, only 8% actually filed them. The image provides a visual representation of this gap between motivation and execution.

**Importance:**

The image highlights a crucial issue: even with motivation and exposure to innovation techniques like TRIZ, actual patent filing rates remain low. This suggests that there are barriers preventing students from translating their motivation into concrete action. The text corroborates this, citing "procedural and resource-related barriers" and suggesting workshops on patent filing as a solution.

In essence, the image is a visual aid that supports the argument that while the course is successful in fostering motivation, there's a need for additional support and resources to help students navigate the patent filing process and turn their ideas into patents.

    *   **Percentage Values:** "26.7%" and "73.3%"
    *   **Legend:** Provides the color key and labels corresponding to each response option: "It helped greatly" (light green), "It helped somewhat" (orange), "It helped minimally" (pink - but no pink segment), "No, it didn't help" (gray - but no gray segment). Note there aren't slices or values for "It helped minimally" or "No, it didn't help".

**Significance:**

The pie chart visually represents the distribution of responses to the question about the impact of working on socio-economic issues on understanding the real-world impact of creative problem-solving. The "exploded" slice highlighting that 26.7% responded with it helped greatly emphasizes the positive reception and could also be indicative of the importance that slice holds to the analysis/authors.

**Overall Context and Importance:**

Based on the surrounding text, the pie chart illustrates findings from a survey of 15 individuals regarding a course or program related to creative problem-solving, likely TRIZ or a similar methodology. The text accompanying the chart states that "73.3% stated that it helped somewhat, while 26.7% found that it helped greatly. None of the respondents reported minimal or no impact." This confirms what is being represented in the visual.

The chart is important because it quantifies the perceived value of incorporating socio-economic challenges into the learning process. It supports the argument that engaging with real-world problems enhances understanding of the practical applications of creative problem-solving techniques. This is likely a point the authors are trying to make to justify the curriculum's design or to suggest improvements for future iterations. The chart adds visual weight to the statement in the paper.



=== Page 23 ===
The chart captures the responses of 15 individuals regarding whether working on socio-economic
issues helped them understand the real-world impact of creative problem-solving. A majority,
73.3%, stated that it helped somewhat, while 26.7% found that it helped greatly. None of the
respondents reported minimal or no impact.
These findings indicate that engaging with socio-economic challenges provides substantial
insights into the practical applications of creative problem-solving, with varying degrees of
effectiveness.
The responses highlight the perceived relevance of problem analysis skills in navigating
challenges in current roles among 15 individuals. A significant portion, 46.7%, reported that
these skills provide a useful framework in some cases, while 33.3% found them occasionally
relevant. Notably, 20% stated that these skills are essential for addressing challenges,
demonstrating a direct and critical application. None of the respondents indicated that these skills
are irrelevant.
These results suggest that problem analysis skills are generally valuable, with varying levels
of applicability depending on the situation.

The chart reflects the impact of focusing on specific technical challenges on problem-solving
abilities in the current or aspiring roles of 10 respondents. Half of the respondents (50%)
indicated that it significantly enhanced their skills. 40% stated that it helped, but only in certain
technical areas, while 10% felt it did not make a significant difference.
These findings suggest that focusing on technical challenges can lead to substantial skill
improvement, particularly in relevant areas, although the impact may vary across different
technical domains.
The data presented in the chart regarding the impact of focusing on specific technical challenges
has a low confidence level. This is because the respondents, primarily students, have either not
yet entered the workforce or have not been in the industry long enough to fully assess the
long-term impact of these skills in real-world professional contexts. Therefore, the conclusions
drawn should be interpreted with caution and may require further validation through follow-up
studies involving participants with more substantial industry experience.

The responses indicate the frequency of using technical skills learned in the course among 9
participants in their current projects or jobs. A majority, 88.9%, reported using these skills
sometimes, while 11.1% stated they use them very often. None of the respondents indicated
rarely or never using these skills.
These results highlight that while the technical skills acquired are utilized, their application
is not consistent or frequent for most individuals, suggesting that these skills may
complement other competencies in their roles.
The data regarding the frequency of using technical skills learned in the course has a low
confidence level. This is because the respondents, primarily students or early-career
professionals, may not yet have sufficient exposure or opportunities to fully integrate these skills
into their professional work.

Conclusion
The findings of this study emphasize the profound significance of creative thinking and
problem-solving skills in professional environments, underscoring their critical role in
overcoming challenges and fostering innovation. A substantial majority of respondents
acknowledged the high professional relevance of these skills, particularly in generating novel
ideas and balancing priorities, while barriers such as time management and technical
problem-solving were frequently cited. The variability in the application of CIIPS
principles—ranging from occasional to frequent use—demonstrates their adaptability to diverse
roles and contexts, though certain areas, such as stakeholder management, exhibited lower
applicability.
The course methodology effectively engaged diverse learning styles, leveraging hands-on and
visual approaches. Interactive teaching methods and a balanced integration of theory and practice
were well-received, though feedback highlighted opportunities to further enhance peer-to-peer
interactions and group discussions. Retention challenges, including difficulty remembering
specifics, perceived irrelevance, and lack of confidence, indicate the need for more real-world
examples, refresher materials, and sustained reinforcement of course concepts.

LLM Integration Outcomes: The integration of a fine-tuned large language model (LLM) to
generate function models and assist with systematic innovation tools significantly enhanced
students’ ability to structure problems and ideate effectively. Students found the LLM
particularly useful for translating abstract patent language into actionable insights, reducing
cognitive load, and accelerating the innovation process. However, broader adoption would
benefit from guided tutorials and more contextual examples to maximize its utility across varying
problem domains.
Future Plans
With the research paper now finalized and ready for submission, our focus will shift towards
leveraging our findings to advance both academic discourse and practical applications of the
CIIPS methodology. Building on the momentum of this study, our future plans include:
● Research Dissemination:
We will submit our paper to reputed journals and conferences focused on innovation in
education and interdisciplinary learning. This will help share our insights with a broader
academic and professional audience and invite collaborative feedback for refinement.
● Scaling LLM Capabilities:
We aim to train our fine-tuned large language model (LLM) on an even larger and more
diverse dataset, enabling it to generate more accurate and context-aware function models.
This will improve its ability to assist students in ideation, problem framing, and
translating abstract concepts into practical solutions.
● Educational Toolkit Development:
Based on the positive feedback regarding the LLM's support in systematic innovation, we
plan to develop an educational toolkit powered by the model. This toolkit will include
step-by-step innovation guides, automated function model generators, and real-world case
studies to enhance learning outcomes.
Through these initiatives, we aim to bridge educational research with scalable, tech-driven
