CHAPTER-1
INTRODUCTION
1.1 Introduction
Charge pump circuits play a critical role in modern electronics, offering efficient
solutions for generating higher or lower voltage levels without the need for bulky
inductors or transformers. Among the various topologies, the Dickson Charge Pump
(DCP) stands as a classic approach, widely used for its simplicity and ability to
achieve high output voltages. However, it suffers from inherent limitations, such as
threshold voltage loss and efficiency drops due to parasitic elements. To address
these challenges, alternative topologies and techniques have been developed, each
aiming to improve the performance metrics of charge pumps.
One such topology is the Cross-Coupled Charge Pump (CCCP), which leverages
complementary branches of NMOS and PMOS transistors. The alternating clock
signals enable efficient charge transfer across capacitors, significantly reducing the
threshold voltage loss that plagues the Dickson Charge Pump. This topology
achieves higher efficiency and greater output voltage but faces design challenges,
including reversion loss, conduction loss, and short-circuit loss.
In addition, advanced techniques like the Clock Booster enhance the performance of
charge pumps by increasing the clock signal amplitude. This approach improves
gain, reduces the number of stages required, and leads to faster rise times and
potential silicon area savings. The clock booster topology, when combined with the
Dickson Charge Pump or Cross-Coupled Charge Pump, can further optimize
performance metrics such as output voltage, efficiency, and gain.
This project delves into a detailed analysis and comparison of various charge pump
topologies, including the Dickson Charge Pump, Cross-Coupled Charge Pump, and
Clock Booster configurations. Through extensive simulations and evaluations, the
project explores key performance parameters such as output voltage (Vout), output
current (Iout), gain, efficiency, rise time, and phase response under varying
conditions, including supply voltage, load, and the number of stages. The objective
is to identify and analyze the trade-offs among these topologies and optimize them
for specific applications, ensuring maximum efficiency and performance in real-
world scenarios.

By understanding the strengths and limitations of these topologies and techniques,
this study aims to contribute to the development of more efficient charge pump
designs suitable for modern integrated circuits and power management systems.
1.2 Problem Statement
Our project involves analyzing various charge pump topologies for non-volatile
memories and conducting a detailed comparison in terms of power, performance,
and area (PPA) to identify the most optimal topology. The goal is to understand the
trade-offs and design considerations inherent in each topology, evaluate their
suitability for different memory applications, and select the best approach based on
comprehensive PPA metrics. Additionally, we aim to consider factors such as
scalability, ease of integration into existing systems, and potential challenges in
implementation. Through this analysis, we seek to recommend a charge pump
topology that offers the most balanced and efficient solution for modern non-volatile
memory technologies.

LITERATURE REVIEW
2.1 Different Topologies of Charge Pump
2.1.1 Dickson Charge Pump : The Dickson charge pump is a type of voltage
multiplier circuit that John F. Dickson originally proposed in the late 1970s. It is
commonly used in integrated circuits to generate higher voltages from a lower supply
voltage, particularly in applications like EEPROM and flash memory programming.
The conventional four-stage Dickson charge pump consists of capacitors and
transistors. These components are arranged such that each capacitor is connected to
the next through a transistor, and nonoverlapping clock signals drive all stages.
Dickson charge pump has several disadvantages, including threshold voltage drops
across each diode, reverse charge sharing between stages, reduced efficiency with
increased stages, higher power consumption due to the need for non-overlapping
clock signals, and performance degradation from leakage currents in modern
semiconductor processes.

[Image page_9_image_7.png Analysis (by Gemini)]
Okay, I've analyzed the image and the surrounding text provided.

**Image Analysis**

The image appears to be completely black. This means there is no visible information within the image itself.

**Text within the image:**

There is no text visible in the image.

The image is important as it provides a visual representation of one of the fundamental charge pump topologies, which is essential for understanding its operation and comparing it to other topologies. The goal is to improve charge pump design for use in integrated circuits and power management systems.

capacitors store and transfer charge between different stages driven by alternating
clock signals. The elimination of threshold voltage loss, which is common in
Dickson charge pumps, and generally higher efficiency due to avoiding large voltage
drops are key advantages of this topology. However, the cross-coupled charge pump
faces challenges such as reversion loss due to improper clock timing, conduction loss
from the resistance of the MOSFETs, and short-circuit loss when both NMOS and
PMOS transistors turn on simultaneously.

2.1.3 Clock Booster Circuit: A clock booster circuit is a specialized topology
designed to increase the amplitude of a clock signal, making it suitable for
applications requiring high-voltage clocks to drive capacitive loads, such as charge
pump circuits. This topology is essential in scenarios where standard low-voltage
clock signals are insufficient to efficiently charge capacitive loads or meet the
operational requirements of the circuit. By boosting the clock amplitude, the circuit
ensures better driving capability and enhances performance, particularly in high-
voltage operations.
The primary advantages of using a clock booster include its ability to effectively
drive large capacitive loads, improve the efficiency of charge pump circuits, and
integrate seamlessly into compact designs without significant overhead. However,
there are also disadvantages, such as increased power consumption, which can be a
concern for low-power applications. Additionally, the incorporation of a clock

booster adds complexity to the design and may introduce noise or coupling issues in
sensitive parts of the circuit.
The practical impact of the proposed differential charge pump (DCP) with a clock
booster (CKB) topology is significant for non-volatile memory applications. It
reduces rise time considerably, which is crucial for improving operational speed, or
alternatively, it can save silicon area while maintaining the same level of
performance. Furthermore, the design provides flexibility, allowing designers to
trade off between speed and area based on specific application requirements, making
it highly adaptable to diverse scenarios.
Fig 2.3: Clock Booster Circuit
2.1.4 Cross Coupled charge pump with Clock Booster: A clock booster integrated
with a cross-coupled charge pump is a specialized circuit topology designed to
enhance the efficiency and performance of charge pump systems. In this design, the
clock booster amplifies the amplitude of the clock signals before driving the cross-
coupled charge pump stages. This boosted clock signal improves the pump's ability
to charge the output capacitance efficiently, enabling the generation of higher output
voltages.
The use of a cross-coupled topology in conjunction with a clock booster provides
key advantages. The cross-coupled structure inherently reduces voltage ripple at the
output and enhances charge transfer efficiency by balancing the operation of
complementary charge transfer paths. When combined with a clock booster, the
overall system can achieve higher pumping efficiency and reduced rise time, which
is crucial for applications like non-volatile memory programming and high-voltage
driver circuits.

which enhances the speed of operation. Additionally, it offers flexibility in
optimizing the circuit for speed or area depending on application-specific needs.
However, this approach also comes with challenges, such as increased power
consumption due to the clock boosting stage and potential design complexity arising
from integrating the clock booster with the cross-coupled pump.

of a clock booster circuit with the traditional Dickson charge pump topology to
enhance voltage generation efficiency. The Dickson charge pump, a popular
topology for voltage multiplication, relies on diodes or diode-connected transistors
and capacitors to transfer and boost charge progressively across stages. However,
the voltage gain in a Dickson charge pump is influenced by the amplitude of the
clock signals used to drive the capacitors.
By incorporating a clock booster, the amplitude of the clock signals is increased
beyond the standard supply voltage, enabling the Dickson charge pump to achieve
higher output voltages with fewer stages. This configuration improves the overall
efficiency of the charge pump, reduces power losses, and minimizes voltage drops
due to parasitic resistances and diode forward voltages.
The advantages of using a clock booster with a Dickson charge pump include
enhanced output voltage levels, improved efficiency in charge transfer, and the
ability to generate high voltages with a smaller number of stages, which saves silicon
area. Additionally, the boosted clock signals reduce the dependency on the supply
voltage, making the circuit suitable for low-power applications. However, the

disadvantages include added circuit complexity, increased power consumption for
boosting the clock signals, and potential challenges in managing noise or coupling
effects due to higher signal amplitudes.
In practical applications, this integration is particularly beneficial for circuits that
require high output voltages, such as non-volatile memory programming or driving
sensors and actuators. The boosted clock ensures that the capacitors in the Dickson
charge pump are optimally charged and discharged, significantly reducing rise times
and enhancing performance. Moreover, it offers designers flexibility to optimize the
trade-offs between speed, area, and power efficiency based on specific application
requirements.
2.1.6 PMOS Switch Based Charge Pump: The PMOS-switch-based charge pump
is a novel and efficient topology designed to overcome the limitations of traditional
charge pump circuits, particularly those based on the Dickson architecture. It
leverages the advantages of PMOS transistors and a four-phase clocking mechanism
to achieve high performance and cost-effective implementation in a standard 0.18µm
CMOS process. Unlike conventional designs that rely on NMOS transistors and
often face issues such as threshold voltage degradation and body effect, this topology
employs low-voltage PMOS devices that inherently avoid these challenges. PMOS
transistors eliminate the threshold voltage drop and are unaffected by the body effect,
ensuring stable and efficient operation across varying supply voltages and
temperature ranges.
The design maintains a maximum voltage drop across any PMOS transistor below
the power supply voltage, capped at 2.0V for the given process. By adhering to this
limitation, the need for specialized high-voltage devices or thick gate oxides is
eliminated, simplifying the manufacturing process and reducing overall costs. This
simplicity allows the charge pump to be implemented entirely within a standard
CMOS process, making it particularly appealing for large-scale applications where
cost and integration are critical.

Fig 2.5: 1-stage of pmos based charge pump
A key feature of the charge pump is its four-phase clocking mechanism. This
approach ensures precise timing for the switching operations of the PMOS
transistors, enabling efficient charge transfer and minimizing energy losses. The
clocking system is derived from a single reference clock, which is further divided
into four non-overlapping phases to ensure proper operation without cross-
conduction. This efficient clocking mechanism allows the charge pump to achieve
high voltage gains while maintaining operational stability.
The topology incorporates a cascade of stages, each consisting of PMOS switches
and capacitors. Boost capacitors are employed to store and transfer charge between
stages, with auxiliary capacitors regulating voltage undershoots at critical nodes to
ensure reliable performance. In the 3-stage implementation, boost capacitance is set
at 4pF, and auxiliary capacitance is 100fF, chosen to balance output requirements
with minimal component overhead.
Performance-wise, the charge pump achieves remarkable results. It can deliver an
output voltage of up to 14V in an 11-stage configuration powered by a supply voltage
as low as 1.2V. This corresponds to an impressive gain per stage of 97% of the supply
voltage, indicating minimal loss across the stages. Furthermore, the design
demonstrates a temperature-independent efficiency of 53%, maintaining stable
operation across a wide range of temperatures (25°C to 125°C) and supply voltages
(1.2V to 2V). These characteristics underscore its reliability and suitability for
applications demanding consistent performance under varying conditions.
Compared to traditional Dickson charge pumps, this design represents a significant
improvement. Dickson charge pumps, which typically utilize NMOS switches,
suffer from gain degradation due to the threshold voltage drop and body effect,
especially in the final stages of the pump. These issues limit the number of stages

=== Page 15 ===
that can be cascaded and reduce the overall efficiency of the circuit. The PMOS-
switch-based topology not only avoids these drawbacks but also simplifies the
design by eliminating the need for high-voltage or triple-well devices, making it
more compatible with standard CMOS processes.
This charge pump topology finds its primary application in low-voltage systems,
such as Flash and EEPROM memories, where high output voltage and efficiency are
essential. Its cost-effective design, achieved by leveraging standard CMOS
technology, allows for widespread adoption in these domains. The combination of
high gain, temperature independence, and simplified implementation establishes this
charge pump as a robust and versatile solution for modern low-power electronic
systems.
2.1.7Substrate Control Charge Pump: Another variation of the Dickson Charge
Pump is the Substrate Control Charge Pump, which uses the MOSFET body as an
active terminal to mitigate issues related to the threshold voltage increase in the
charge transfer device . For positive pumping, the circuit is composed solely of
pMOSFETs, making it compact with minimal risk of latchup. Fig. 2.6. An illustration
of the Substrate Charge Pump Figure 2.6 depicts the Substrate Control Charge Pump
schematic, which consists of two auxiliary MOSFETs to control the body bias
Charge Transfer MOSFET. In each charge-transfer stage, the bodies of all MOSFETs
are connected and, simultaneously, separated from the bodies of other stages. In each
Charge Transfer block, the source and gate of the Charge Transfer MOSFET are
shared with the source of one auxiliary MOSFET, and another auxiliary MOSFET
shares the drain. When the clk is low and clk is high, the ith charge transfer
MOSFET, and the source-sharing auxiliary MOSFET are turned on. With this, the
body and source of the Charge Transfer Block are connected while transferring
charges to the next stage, making VSB equal to 0 resulting in the threshold voltage
being equal to Vto(threshold voltage at zero back bias). The (i-1)th charge transfer
MOSFET is off and it’s drain side auxiliary MOSFET turns on connecting the body
and drain of the (i-1)th charge transfer MOSFET. In this way, the body effect of the
Charge Transfer Switch MOSFET’s body is removed by connecting the substrate to
the highest voltage potential in the stage so that the voltage gain improves with the
increase in stages without much effect of the threshold voltage drop. Considering the
second stage, i.e., i=2, when clk is high and clk is low, the charge transfer switch is
ON and its source voltage is higher than the drain voltage by 2VDD and the source
terminal MOSFET turns ON since it’s gate to source voltage is −2VDD. All the body
terminals of all the PMOS in the 2nd stage are connected to the node V1, the highest
potential of the stage. Additionally, when clk is low and clk is high, the Charge
Transfer Switch in the 2nd stage is OFF and the and the node voltage at V2 is higher
15

=== Page 16 ===
than V1 by 2VDD. The auxiliary PMOS at the drain side of the 2nd stage is turned
ON as its gate to source voltage is −2VDD. The drain and body of the 2nd stage
Charge Transfer Switch are connected and the substrate is prevented from floating .

DESIGN ANALYSIS & PROPOSED WORK
3.2 Proposed Work
In the proposed work on a cross-coupled charge pump with a clock booster topology,
we designed and implemented a clock booster circuit to enhance the voltage of the
pulse driving the charge pump. This design is specifically tailored for applications
in non-volatile memories, where higher voltage efficiency and faster operation are
critical. One of the key advantages of this topology is the reduction in rise time,
which enables faster memory operation. Additionally, by incorporating the clock
booster, we can significantly reduce the number of stages in the charge pump. For
instance, instead of requiring a 5-stage charge pump to achieve a target voltage, the
same voltage can now be achieved with far fewer stages, resulting in a more compact
and efficient design. The schematic of the circuit, created and simulated on Cadence
Virtuoso, is shown below."

4.2 Layout
In this work, we present two layouts: one without the pumping capacitor and another
with the pumping capacitor. Both layouts were designed on 65 nm CMOS
technology and successfully passed clean Design Rule Check (DRC) and Layout
Versus Schematic (LVS) verification. While creating the layout for the pumping
capacitor, we encountered challenges in achieving the required capacitance within
the design constraints. To address this, we utilized a MOS capacitor by shorting the
gate, source, and drain terminals, which provided an efficient solution for area
optimization and design feasibility. The layouts were meticulously routed, with the
highest metal layer used being Metal2, ensuring efficient signal routing while
minimizing parasitics and maintaining layout simplicity. The design process adhered
to strict guidelines for manufacturability and performance, ensuring the layouts are
robust and meet the intended specifications.

CHAPTER 5
CONCLUSION & FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS
5.1 Conclusion
In this work, we proposed and implemented a cross-coupled charge pump with a
clock booster topology, specifically designed for applications in non-volatile
memories. The clock booster circuit enhances the voltage of the driving pulse,
enabling faster memory operations by reducing the rise time and minimizing the
number of charge pump stages. This innovation allows us to achieve the desired
output voltage with fewer stages, resulting in a more compact and efficient design.
The schematic designs and simulations were carried out in Cadence Virtuoso, where
performance metrics such as output voltage, rise time, and power efficiency were
thoroughly analyzed. The clock booster circuit effectively drives the cross-coupled
charge pump, as demonstrated by its improved performance compared to
conventional designs.
This work demonstrates significant advancements in the design of efficient charge
pump circuits for memory applications while highlighting areas for future work to
improve efficiency and reliability in practical applications.
5.2 Future Enhancements
In our group, we analyzed various parameters of different charge pump designs. Our
goal is to compile all these parameters into an Excel file and develop a machine
learning model. This model will predict the design attributes, such as the size of
transistors and the pumping capacitor, based on user-defined specifications.
While we successfully extracted several parameters, we faced challenges in
completing the layout due to issues with capacitor modeling. As a result, we
currently lack the size parameter necessary for accurate modeling.
Addressing these challenges forms the basis for our future enhancements.
Specifically, we aim to resolve the capacitor modeling issues and extract the missing
size parameters. Once these improvements are implemented, the machine learning
model will enable automated design optimization and parameter estimation,
streamlining the charge pump design process for a wide range of applications.
