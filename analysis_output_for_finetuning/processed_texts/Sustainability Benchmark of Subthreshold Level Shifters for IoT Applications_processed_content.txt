**Significance and Context**

*   **Level Shifters (SLS):** The paper focuses on Level Shifters, which are circuits that enable communication between different voltage domains within an integrated circuit (IC). This is crucial for modern low-power design where different parts of a chip operate at different voltages to save energy. Specifically, the architectures shift voltage from sub-threshold VDDL (0.3V) to nominal VDDH (1.2V).
*   **Subthreshold Operation:** The paper emphasizes subthreshold operation as a key technique for low-power design. This means the transistors operate at voltages below their threshold voltage, using leakage current to switch.
*   **Sustainable Design:**  The overall goal of the paper is to evaluate the *sustainability* of different SLS architectures. This includes considering the energy consumed *during operation* (dynamic and static power) and the *embodied energy* (environmental impact of manufacturing, influenced by the number of fabrication masks required).
*   **Image Importance:** Fig. 3 is important because it visually presents the more advanced level shifter architectures that are being investigated in the paper. The description of each architecture in the text, coupled with the diagrams, allows the reader to understand the trade-offs (power, speed, area, robustness) of each design.
*   **Relationship to Other Figures:** The text explicitly mentions that the diagrams in Fig. 3 are considered "advanced SLS" compared to "conventional SLS" illustrated in Fig. 2.
*   **Paper Focus:** By examining these architectures, the paper aims to establish a method for designers to assess the sustainability of their choices early in the design process (at the level of individual logic cells, like these level shifters).

**Detailed Analysis of the Circuits (Based on Textual Descriptions)**

While I can't provide a detailed circuit analysis without seeing the actual schematics in the image, here's what the text reveals about the function and design choices of each level shifter:

*   **DSELS:** Uses a "PMOS-NMOS cross-coupled (PNCC) current limiter," a "multi-VT transistor strategy" for efficiency, and a "self-adaptive pull-up network" for faster switching. The key feature is the PNCC limiter for current contention and leakage reduction. It also uses a "split-input buffer" to provide controlled leakage and energy efficiency. Has signal integrity issues due to floating nodes Z and Zb.

*   **RSWCRLS:** Modifies the CCLS configuration to reduce current contention by using an "NMOS-diode-based current limiter" in the pull-up network. It also incorporates a "stacked high-threshold voltage (HVT) inverter configuration" to overcome issues caused by voltage drop at internal nodes Q1 and Q2.

*   **LPSVTLS:** Follows the CCLS principle but incorporates "Dynamic Current Generators" in the PU network to improve output transition speed. These generators are only active during transitions, reducing static power.

*   **C3MLS:** A hybrid design combining the strengths of CCLS and CMLS. It uses dynamic current generators to minimize static power. It leverages "high-threshold voltage (HVT) pull-up devices" to limit the strength of the PU network.

In conclusion, Fig. 3 is a crucial visual component of the paper, showcasing the advanced level shifter architectures that are being evaluated for their sustainability characteristics. The text provides key insights into the design principles and trade-offs of each architecture.

This is a low-power technique, but requires careful level shifter design to ensure reliable signal transitions.
*   **Sustainability:** The overall aim of the paper is to assess the *sustainability* of different level shifter designs. This includes considering the carbon footprint of both manufacturing (embodied footprint) and operation (operational footprint). The paper aims to provide designers with a way to choose more environmentally friendly level shifter architectures.

*   **Power and Ground:** Symbols for power supply (Vddh, Vddl) and ground are shown.

**Text within the Image:**

*   **Vddh:** Label indicating a high-voltage power supply.
*   **Vddl:** Label indicating a low-voltage power supply.
*   **IN:** Label indicating the input signal to the circuit.
*   **OUT:** Label indicating the output signal from the circuit.

**Context and Importance:**

*   **Level Shifter:** The image appears to depict a "Robust Subthreshold Level Shifter with Wide Conversion Range (RSWCRLS)" based on the text "Fig.3. ... (b)RobustSubthresholdLevelShifterwithWideConversionRange(RSWCRLS) [13] ...".
*   **Purpose of Level Shifters:** The text from the surrounding pages indicates that level shifters are used to interface between different voltage domains in an integrated circuit (IC). This is important because some parts of the IC might operate at lower voltages for power efficiency, while others need higher voltages for performance.
*   **Subthreshold Operation:** The surrounding text mentions "subthreshold operation." This means the transistors in the level shifter are designed to operate at voltages below their threshold voltage (Vt), which reduces power consumption.
*   **Description of the RSWCRLS Design:** According to the text, the RSWCRLS is a modified version of the "Cross-Coupled Level Shifter (CCLS)." It uses an NMOS-diode-based current limiter to reduce current contention in the pull-up network, improving level-shifting performance.
*   **Problem and Solution:** The current limiter can cause a voltage drop at the internal nodes Q1 and Q2, potentially leading to high short-circuit current in the output inverter. The solution is to use a stacked high-threshold voltage (HVT) inverter at the output. This is visible in the image with the series of transistors before the OUT label.
*   **Relevance to Sustainability:** The research paper aims to evaluate the "sustainability" of different level shifter architectures. This involves considering both the energy consumption during operation and the environmental impact of manufacturing. The design choices in the RSWCRLS, such as the use of a current limiter and HVT transistors, would likely affect both its energy efficiency and its manufacturing complexity (and therefore its carbon footprint).

In summary, the image shows the circuit diagram of a Robust Subthreshold Level Shifter with Wide Conversion Range (RSWCRLS). This level shifter is designed for low-power operation by using subthreshold techniques. The RSWCRLS design is intended to improve performance and robustness, with specific features to address potential drawbacks of its design. It is crucial to the research paper as an example of the different designs that will be analysed based on sustainability.

*   OUT

**Image Context and Significance:**

The image is labeled as part of Fig. 3, so this particular figure is one of four advanced level shifters that are discussed in the paper. The surrounding text indicates the paper discusses subthreshold level shifters (SLS) and their energy efficiency for IC (Integrated Circuit) design.

Specifically, this diagram is most likely for "Robust Subthreshold Level Shifter With Wide Conversion Range (RSWCRLS)" [13], because the description in the text describes an inverter (the one with the Vddl) and it mentions transistors Q1 and Q2 (the nodes), all of which are in the diagram.

Level shifters, as described in the text, are crucial components that allow circuits to operate in different voltage domains within an IC. This is vital for energy efficiency, as some parts of the chip can operate at lower voltages to conserve power, while others can run at higher voltages for performance. The specific architecture in the diagram aims to translate a low-voltage input signal (subthreshold, "Vddl") to a higher voltage output ("Vddh").

**Importance:**

The image's importance stems from the paper's focus on sustainable VLSI design. By illustrating the circuit architecture of a level shifter, the image helps readers understand:

[Image page_5_image_5.png Analysis (by Gemini)]
Here's an analysis of the image based on the surrounding text and the image itself:

**Overall Context:**

This image (specifically Fig. 7(b), based on the page text) depicts the layout of the "DSELS Version II" architecture, a type of level shifter circuit, in STM's 65nm technology. The research focuses on evaluating the sustainability of different level shifter (SLS) architectures. This image visualizes one of the design variations that explores different routing strategies using different metal layers to optimize area, performance, and ultimately, the "embodied footprint" which is a sustainability metric.

**Visual Elements and Their Structure:**

*   **Layout Diagram:** The primary element is a top-down layout diagram of the DSELS Version II level shifter circuit. The diagram shows the physical arrangement of various components and interconnects within the integrated circuit.
*   **Color Coding:** Different colors are used to represent different layers of the chip. Common layers include:
    *   Metal Layers (likely different colors for Metal1, Metal2, etc.). Metal layers are used for routing interconnects. The red color likely represents the interconnections between the layers.
    *   Polysilicon:  Used for transistor gates.
    *   Diffusion Areas: Form the source and drain regions of transistors.
    *   Via layers:  Represent connections between different metal layers.
*   **Power/Ground Rails:**  There are clearly marked power rails (VDDH and VDDL) and a ground rail (Gnd). These rails supply power to the circuit.
*   **Inputs and Outputs:**  The layout indicates input (likely X, Y) and output (Out) terminals.
*   **Double-Row Format:** The layout adheres to the double-row format mentioned in the surrounding text. This involves arranging the circuit elements in two rows, sharing a ground rail between the power rails.
*   **Track Representation:** The image provides a horizontal arrow labelled "11 T", indicating that the design's width occupies 11 vertical tracks. This is a crucial metric for area efficiency.

**Text within the Image:**

The visible text labels within the image are:

*   **VDDH:** Indicates the High-Voltage power rail.
*   **VDDL:** Indicates the Low-Voltage power rail.
*   **Gnd:** Indicates the Ground rail.
*   **Xb, X, Y:** Representing Input signals.
*   **Out:**  Representing the output signal.
*   **11 T:** Indicates the width of the cell in terms of number of Tracks.
*   **plus/pus**: Indicates a P-type transistor.

**Significance:**

*   **Version II vs. Version I:** Based on the text and other figure descriptions, Version II incorporates the GND rail in the Metal2 layer while the rest of the routing is confined to Metal1. This change aims to reduce track usage. Version I (Fig. 7(a) and the surrounding text) uses only Metal1.
*   **Area Optimization:** The design goal is to reduce the cell width (number of tracks). By moving the ground rail to M2, the design achieves a smaller width compared to Version I (which is 12T, according to the text describing Figure 7(a)).
*   **Sustainability Implications:** The layout choices directly affect the sustainability metrics discussed in Section IV of the paper. A smaller area (fewer tracks) generally reduces the "embodied footprint." However, using M2 for the ground rail may increase the "congestion factor," affecting the overall system-level routing efficiency and fabrication complexity, which can impact sustainability.
*   **Masks:** The "DSELS" architecture requires three extra masks ('VTL N', 'VTL P', and 'VTH P' CAD layers). This information is also pertinent to the sustainability assessment, as extra masks contribute to a higher embodied footprint.
*   **Performance and Trade-offs:** While the text focuses on area reduction and sustainability, the different versions of layouts also impact the circuit's performance (propagation delay, power consumption). Table I contains data on different versions for different level shifters and their performance.

In summary, this image provides a visual representation of the DSELS Version II layout, highlighting the physical arrangement of circuit elements and the track usage. The image is important because it illustrates the design choices made to optimize area and, indirectly, the sustainability of the level shifter architecture.

    *   The layout appears to be organized into three sections vertically, with distinct blocks. The middle section is labeled "Gnd," indicating the ground rail.
    *   Power supply rails (VDDH and VDDL) are at the top and bottom respectively.

**Context and Significance (based on surrounding text)**

*   **Overall Context:** The image is a layout of one version of a "RSWCRLS" (Reduced Swing Cascode Restored Level Shifter) circuit, specifically Version II, which is a type of level shifter designed for subthreshold logic. Level shifters are crucial in low-power designs because they translate voltage levels between different parts of a circuit operating at different voltages. Subthreshold logic aims to reduce power consumption by operating transistors with voltages below their threshold voltage.

*   **Importance:** The image is important because it illustrates the physical implementation of the RSWCRLS circuit. This allows the researchers to analyze and compare its area, track usage, and layout characteristics with other level shifter designs. The paper is focused on assessing the sustainability of different level shifter architectures, and the layout contributes significantly to the embodied footprint (energy consumption during manufacturing).

*   **Connection to Text:**

    *   The text directly refers to Figure 8, which this image belongs to.
    *   The text states that the RSWCRLS architecture uses additional ‘VTL N’, ‘VTL P’, ‘VTH N’, and ‘VTH P’ CAD layers, i.e., four extra masks are required to manufacture it.
    *   The text mentions that Version I has a 10T cell width, whereas Version II reduces the width to 9T by utilizing an M2 track. The "9T" label on the image confirms that this is indeed Version II. The use of M2 for the ground rail is a key feature described in the text, and it's visible as the wider, purple "Gnd" rail in the image.
    *   The surrounding text discusses the impact of using upper metal layers (like M2) on routing congestion at the SoC level. While it allows for a denser layout, it can reduce available routing resources for other signals, potentially increasing fabrication complexity and energy consumption.
    *   The embodied footprint metric, described in the paper, is directly related to layout area, mask count, and congestion. This image is a visual representation of the area component of that metric.

In summary, the image is a crucial visual aid in understanding the physical characteristics of the RSWCRLS level shifter design. Its layout details are directly linked to the sustainability analysis presented in the research paper.

**Context and Significance**

The image represents the layout of the "LPSVTLS Version I" Level Shifter architecture, referenced in Figure 9(a) of the research paper. This type of image is crucial for understanding the physical implementation and area efficiency of different Level Shifter designs.

Here's a breakdown of the context and significance:

*   **Level Shifters:** Level shifters are essential circuits in systems with multiple voltage domains, such as low-power IoT devices. They convert signals from one voltage level to another, enabling communication between different parts of the system.
*   **Layout Variations:** The research paper compares different layout variations (Version I and Version II) of various Level Shifter architectures (CCLS, CMLS, DSELS, RSWCRLS, LPSVTLS, and C3MLS).  The goal is to evaluate the impact of these variations on sustainability metrics.
*   **Track Usage and Area:** The image shows "17T" (17 tracks) width and "26T" high, indicating the cell's dimensions in terms of standard cell tracks. Reducing track usage is a primary objective, as it directly impacts cell area.
*   **Metal Layer Routing:** The text from surrounding pages indicates that Version I designs primarily use Metal1 (M1) for routing. Version II designs incorporate a GND rail in Metal2 (M2) to potentially reduce track usage and cell width.
*   **Sustainability Assessment:** The paper focuses on assessing the "embodied footprint" of these designs.  The embodied footprint is a measure of the energy consumed and emissions generated during the chip manufacturing process. Area is a key factor in determining the embodied footprint (Eq. 1): `Embodied footprint = k × Area × Mask factor × Congestion factor`
*   **Trade-offs:**  The use of M2 for routing can reduce area but may increase congestion at the SoC level, potentially increasing fabrication complexities. The paper aims to quantify these trade-offs.
*   **Additional Masks:** The design 'LPSVTLS' uses additional ‘VTL N’ and ‘VTL P’ CAD layers, i.e., two extra masks are required to manufacture it.

**Overall Importance**

The image, in conjunction with the surrounding text, is vital for understanding the research methodology. It illustrates how layout optimizations are being explored to minimize the environmental impact of Level Shifter designs.  By comparing different layouts and quantifying their embodied footprints, the researchers aim to provide guidance for selecting the most sustainable Level Shifter architectures for low-power applications. The physical layout details provide insight into the real-world constraints and trade-offs involved in VLSI design for sustainability.

Here's an analysis of the image based on the provided information:

**Image Description**

The image is a detailed layout diagram of a semiconductor circuit, likely representing a standard cell.  It's a top-down view showing the arrangement of various layers and components within the cell.

*   **Color Coding:** Different colors represent different layers of the integrated circuit, such as metal layers for routing (often red), polysilicon for transistor gates (often green), and other layers related to doping regions, contacts, etc. The purple areas likely represent the power rails.
*   **Geometric Shapes:** Rectangles, lines, and other shapes represent the physical arrangement of transistors, wires, and contacts within the cell.
*   **Labels:** There are text labels indicating voltage supplies like "VDDH" (high voltage), "VDDL" (low voltage), "Gnd" (ground), and functional components such as "Out". Transistor labels Q1, Q2, Ab. Also, "pnd" and "pS" are visible.
*   **Size Indicator:** A horizontal double-headed arrow at the bottom shows the cell width is "15 T".

**Text within the Image:**

*   "VDDH": High voltage power supply.
*   "VDDL": Low voltage power supply.
*   "Gnd": Ground.
*   "Out": Output.
*   "Q1, Q2": Transistor labels.
*   "Ab": label.
* "pnd, pS": doping regions
*   "15 T": Cell width indicator (15 tracks).

**Context and Importance**

The image is a layout variation of LPSVTLS Version II.  It is Figure 9(b) according to the text, representing the LPSVTLS (Low Power Super Threshold Level Shifter) architecture. This particular version of the layout uses Metal 2 (M2) for the ground rail.

*   **Overall Research Focus:** The research paper focuses on sustainability assessment in SLS (Level Shifter) designs for low-power IoT applications. The researchers are trying to evaluate and optimize the environmental impact of these circuits during manufacturing (embodied footprint) and operation (operational footprint).
*   **Layout Variations:**  The paper explores different layout techniques, specifically comparing versions that confine routing to Metal 1 (M1) versus versions that incorporate Metal 2 (M2) for the ground rail.
*   **Track Reduction:** The caption specifically mentions that incorporating the GND rail in M2 reduces the track usage. The initial version requires 17 tracks, while the M2 version requires 15 tracks.
*   **Sustainability Metrics:** The layout variations are being analyzed for their impact on sustainability. Using M2 can reduce the cell area, potentially improving sustainability (reduced embodied footprint). However, it can also introduce congestion at the system level, which may increase energy consumption and offset the benefits. The paper analyzes the trade-offs using the "Embodied footprint" metric, considering area, mask usage, and congestion.
*   **Mask Usage:**  The surrounding text mentions that this LPSVTLS architecture layout uses additional ‘VTL N’ and ‘VTL P’ CAD layers, i.e., two extra masks are required to manufacture it.

**Significance**

The image is important because it visually demonstrates the layout modifications being studied. It allows readers to see how using a higher metal layer (M2) for the ground rail can physically reduce the cell width and track usage.  This visual representation is crucial for understanding the trade-offs being evaluated and how layout choices can impact the overall sustainability of the SLS design. The image is part of a comparative analysis, showing different versions of the architecture and how specific design decisions affect area, congestion, and, ultimately, the embodied footprint. The paper aims to give designers tools to make informed decisions about designing more sustainable chips early in the design process.

Here's a detailed analysis of the image you provided, incorporating the surrounding text and context:

**Overall Image Description:**

The image is a detailed layout of a VLSI (Very-Large-Scale Integration) circuit.  It depicts the physical arrangement of transistors, metal interconnects, and other components within a standard cell.  It appears to represent the design of a Level Shifter (SLS), specifically for low-power applications.

**Visual Elements and Structure:**

*   **Layout Representation:** The dominant visual element is the intricate layout itself.  Different colors represent different layers of the integrated circuit:
    *   Red (likely Metal 1): This shows the initial routing layer
    *   Other colors (green, purple, blue) represent different layers of silicon, polysilicon, metal 2, vias, or other mask layers, defining transistors and interconnections.
    *   Cross-hatching in some areas, is likely to represent contacts or vias (connections between different metal layers).
*   **Transistors:** The transistors are represented by the intersections of polygons of different colours.
*   **Power Rails:** The top and bottom edges of the cell are demarcated by wider lines, likely representing the power supply rails (VDDH and VDDL, Ground).
*   **Dimensions:** A large yellow arrow with the text "26 T" shows the height of the cell. The width of the cell is labelled at the bottom as "13 T".  "T" refers to the track height within the specific technology node (65nm in this case).

**Text within the Image:**

*   **VDDH:**  Labels for High-Voltage Power Supply rails, at the top of the layout.
*   **VDDL:** Labels for Low-Voltage Power Supply rails, at the bottom of the layout.
*   **Gnd:** Labels the ground connections.
*   **Out:** Labels an output node
*   **A, Ab:** Designates the input ports for the high-to-low level conversion
*   **26 T, 13 T:** Dimensions of the layout. The layout is 26 tracks high and 13 tracks wide.
*   **Transistor Labels:** Labels Q1, Q2, etc. within boxes representing the transistors, which seem to be n-type (labelled n) and p-type (labelled p).

**Context and Importance (based on provided text):**

*   **Level Shifter (SLS) Design:** The layout represents a Level Shifter circuit. Level shifters are crucial in mixed-voltage systems, allowing communication between circuits operating at different voltage levels. This is important in low-power IoT devices where different parts of the system might be powered at different voltages to save energy.
*   **Sustainability Analysis:** The paper's focus is on evaluating the "sustainability" of different SLS architectures. The layout represents a specific instantiation of an SLS design that will be analyzed for its embodied footprint (energy consumed during manufacturing) and operational footprint (energy consumed during operation).
*   **Double-Row Format:** The text mentions that the SLS layouts are designed in a "double-row format" with a shared ground rail. This is evident in the image, with the ground rail running between the VDDH and VDDL rails, and the 26T height suggesting the double row design.
*   **M1 vs. M2 Routing:** The text describes two versions of each SLS architecture: Version I, where routing is confined to Metal 1 (M1), and Version II, where the ground rail is implemented using Metal 2 (M2), with other routing remaining in M1. The layout in the image potentially represents either Version I or Version II. Given the complexity of the traces, and the ground running through the middle, it's likely a version I design.
*   **Track Height (T):** The use of "T" (track height) as a unit of measurement highlights the importance of cell density and routing efficiency in the design.
*   **Embodied Footprint:** The paper uses an equation to estimate the embodied footprint of the SLS design, and includes Area, Mask Factor and Congestion Factor as variables.
*   **Congestion Factor:** As upper metal layers introduce congestion, it reduces the overall SoC routing efficiency. It leads to higher energy consumption during manufacturing.

**Overall Significance:**

This image provides a visual representation of the physical implementation of a level shifter, which is essential for the study's goal of evaluating the "sustainability" (environmental impact) of different design choices. The detailed layout allows for accurate calculation of area, routing congestion, and ultimately, the embodied footprint of the circuit. By comparing different layout variations, the paper aims to identify the most sustainable SLS architecture for low-power IoT applications.


[Image page_6_image_5.png Analysis (by Gemini)]
Here's an analysis of the image based on the provided context:

**Image Description:**

The image shows a detailed layout diagram of a "C3MLS Version II" subthreshold level shifter (SLS) standard cell. It's a top-down view of the integrated circuit layout, illustrating the physical arrangement of transistors, interconnects, and power/ground rails. The cell is annotated with labels indicating key components and signals.

**Visual Elements:**

*   **Layout Diagram:** The primary element is the detailed layout of the C3MLS Version II cell.  It uses different colors and patterns to represent different layers of the integrated circuit, including:
    *   Transistors:  Likely represented by green boxes indicating the active areas, with gate connections shown.
    *   Metal Interconnects: Red lines show the routing of signals and power within the cell.
    *   Power Rails:  VDDH (high voltage) and VDDL (low voltage) are power supply rails, likely in purple.
    *   Ground Rail: A Ground rail (Gnd) is a return path for the power.
*   **Labels:** Text labels annotate various parts of the layout:
    *   `VDDH`: indicates the high-voltage power rail.
    *   `VDDL`: indicates the low-voltage power rail.
    *   `Gnd`: indicates the Ground rail.
    *   `Out`: indicates the output signal.
    *   `Q1`, `Q2`: Transistor labels.
    *   `Ab`: Label for transistor terminal.
    *   `G`: Label for transistor terminal.
    *   `S`: Label for transistor terminal.
    *   `D`: Label for transistor terminal.
*   **Dimensions:** An "11 T" arrow indicates the width of the cell layout, signifying that the cell occupies 11 vertical tracks.

**Text within the Image:**

The following text is visible in the image:

*   `VDDH` (multiple instances): High voltage power supply.
*   `VDDL`: Low voltage power supply.
*   `Gnd`: Ground connection.
*   `Out`: Output signal.
*   `Q1`, `Q2`: Transistor labels.
*   `Ab`: Transistor terminal.
*   `G`: Transistor terminal.
*   `S`: Transistor terminal.
*   `D`: Transistor terminal.
*   `11T`:  Cell width expressed in terms of the number of vertical tracks.

**Context and Significance:**

This image is part of a research paper evaluating the sustainability of different Level Shifter (SLS) architectures.  Specifically, it shows the layout of "C3MLS Version II".

Based on the surrounding text, the image's importance lies in these key aspects:

1.  **Layout Variation:** It exemplifies the second version of the C3MLS architecture, where the Ground (GND) rail is implemented using the Metal 2 (M2) layer. The first version, C3MLS Version I, likely confines all routing to Metal 1 (M1).
2.  **Area Optimization:** The text indicates that incorporating the GND rail in M2 allows for a reduction in the number of vertical tracks required, from 13T in Version I to 11T in Version II.  This translates to a smaller cell area.
3.  **Sustainability Assessment:** The paper proposes metrics to evaluate the "embodied footprint" of VLSI designs, which accounts for the energy consumption and emissions during manufacturing.  The layout area (as depicted in the image) is a direct input to this metric.  The use of M2 for routing, while reducing area, might increase congestion at the SoC level, impacting sustainability.
4.  **Trade-offs:**  The paper explores the trade-offs between different layout strategies. Version II uses an M2 track. While this reduces cell width, it could potentially increase congestion and fabrication complexity (as detailed in the paper), which could affect sustainability.

**Overall Importance:**

The image is crucial for understanding the physical implementation of the C3MLS Level Shifter and its impact on the proposed sustainability metrics.  By visualizing the layout, the reader can appreciate how design choices (like using M2 for the GND rail) influence area, congestion, and ultimately, the embodied footprint of the design. The paper uses these layouts as a basis for comparing different architectures and assessing their overall environmental impact.

Here's a breakdown of the image and its context within the research paper:

**1. Visual Elements and Structure:**

*   **Type:** The image is a bar graph (also known as a bar chart).
*   **Axes:**
    *   The x-axis represents the "Design Name," with the following categories: CCLS, CMLS, DSELS, RSWCRLS, LPSVTLS, and C3MLS. These appear to be different types of Subthreshold Level Shifters (SLS).
    *   The y-axis represents "Footprint (mWh)," with values ranging from 0.0 to 1.6 mWh.
*   **Bars:** For each design name on the x-axis, there are two bars. One represents "Version I" and the other "Version II" of that design. The bars are colored light blue with black borders. Version I bars have diagonal stripes, while Version II bars have a pattern of small circles inside.
*   **Data Labels:** Above each bar is a numerical value representing the exact footprint (in mWh) for that version of the design.
*   **Legend:** A legend in the upper right corner clarifies that striped bars represent "Version I" and dotted bars represent "Version II."
*   **Title:** Lacking, but this is figure 12 and given surrounding text it is titled "Operational footprint for Version I and II of CCLS, CMLS, DSELS, RSWCRLS, LPSVTLS, and C3MLSSubthresholdLevelshifters"

**2. Textual Elements:**

*   **Axis Labels:** "Footprint (mWh)" and "Design Name"
*   **Category Labels:** CCLS, CMLS, DSELS, RSWCRLS, LPSVTLS, C3MLS
*   **Data Values:** 1.282, 1.175, 0.607, 0.622, 0.843, 0.792, 0.730, 0.674, 1.147, 1.037, 0.913, 0.792
*   **Legend:** "Design Versions", "Version I", "Version II"

**3. Data Extraction:**

The graph shows the operational footprint (in mWh) for different versions of six subthreshold level shifter (SLS) designs:

*   CCLS: Version I - 1.282, Version II - 1.175
*   CMLS: Version I - 0.607, Version II - 0.622
*   DSELS: Version I - 0.843, Version II - 0.792
*   RSWCRLS: Version I - 0.730, Version II - 0.674
*   LPSVTLS: Version I - 1.147, Version II - 1.037
*   C3MLS: Version I - 0.913, Version II - 0.792

**4. Context and Importance:**

*   **Overall Goal:** The research aims to evaluate the sustainability of different SLS designs. This image (Fig. 12) focuses on the "Operational footprint," which is defined as the energy consumption and associated emissions of a VLSI design throughout its functional life. This footprint is calculated using dynamic and leakage power over the operating lifetime.
*   **Surrounding Text:** The surrounding text explains that the operational footprint depends on the dynamic and leakage characteristics of the SLS design. The dynamic power consumption depends on the switching factor (α) and operating frequency (f) of the application. The text states that the impact illustrated in this graph is validated on SLS architectures by evaluating their operational footprint for an IoT application with α = 0.3 and f = 100 MHz.
*   **Key Findings (from surrounding text):**
    *   "Versions I and II of the conventional CMLS exhibit the highest Operational footprint among all the SLS designs. Hence, it is the least sustainable choice in this case." (Meaning, based on operational footprint alone).
    *   "Versions I and II of RSWCRLS exhibit the least Operational footprint among all the SLS designs. Hence, it is the most sustainable choice in this case."

**5. Image Significance:**

The image visually presents a comparison of the operational footprints of different SLS designs, highlighting the differences between Version I and Version II of each design. This visualization allows for a clear understanding of which designs are more sustainable from an operational energy consumption perspective. It helps validate the proposed "operational footprint" metric and demonstrates that layout efficiency (area) doesn't necessarily correlate directly with sustainability.  For example, the text states that CMLS has the least embodied footprint, but the *highest* total footprint due to a high operational footprint. Thus it shows that RSWCRLS exhibits the *least* operational footprint among all the SLS designs. Thus the operational footprint varies by application and may mean a different design is the most sustainable option depending on usage conditions and requirements.

Here's a comprehensive analysis of the provided image, integrating its visual elements with the surrounding text from the research paper:

**Overall Image Description**

The image, labeled as "Fig. 12," is a bar graph comparing the operational footprint (measured in mWh) of various Subthreshold Level Shifter (SLS) designs. It presents data for two versions (Version I and Version II) of each design. The x-axis represents the "Design Name," and the y-axis shows "Footprint (mWh)." The graph uses different fill patterns for the bars to distinguish between Version I (diagonal lines) and Version II (circles) of each design.

**Visual Elements and Structure**

*   **Type:** Bar graph
*   **X-axis:** Design Name (CCLS, CMLS, DSELS, RSWCRLS, LPSVTLS, C3MLS)
*   **Y-axis:** Footprint (mWh), ranging from 0 to 10.

**Context and Importance:**

This image is part of a research paper focused on evaluating the sustainability of different Subthreshold Level Shifter (SLS) designs. The study proposes a novel "sustainability evaluation and benchmarking paradigm" to identify environmentally friendly SLS architectures.

Specifically, Fig. 12 visualizes the "operational footprint" of these designs, which is the total energy consumption and associated emissions throughout the functional life of an SLS. The surrounding text details how the operational footprint is calculated, considering dynamic and leakage power over the operating lifetime.

The image is important because it visually compares the operational impact of different SLS designs. It demonstrates that the choice of SLS architecture significantly influences the overall energy consumption. Key observations are:

*   Conventional CMLS designs (Versions I and II) have the highest operational footprint, making them the least sustainable in this case.
*   RSWCRLS designs (Versions I and II) have the least operational footprint, making them the most sustainable in this case.
*   The operational footprint is not just based on layout and depends on other parameters, and varies depending on the usage conditions.

The researchers are arguing that the traditional "PPA (Power, Performance, Area)" metric is insufficient for determining efficiency in an "ecological era." They are advocating for a more comprehensive sustainability assessment, which considers both the "embodied footprint" (manufacturing impact) and the "operational footprint" (usage impact). Fig. 12 directly supports their argument by showing the significant differences in the operational footprint between different SLS designs.

The comparison of Version I and Version II for each design shows the impact of layout optimization techniques (such as using upper metal layers) on the operational footprint.

In conclusion, Fig. 12 is a key visual element of the research paper, providing empirical evidence for the proposed sustainability evaluation paradigm and demonstrating the importance of considering the operational footprint when selecting SLS architectures.

Here's a detailed analysis of the image you provided:

**Overall Description**

The image is a bar graph comparing the "Total Footprint" of different subthreshold level shifter (SLS) designs. Footprint is measured in mWh (milliwatt-hours). The graph presents data for two versions (I and II) of each design, broken down into "Embodied" and "Operational" footprints.

**Visual Elements and Structure**

*   **Type:** Bar Graph
*   **Axes:**
    *   X-axis: "Design Name" (CCLS, CMLS, DSELS, RSWCRLS, LPSVTLS, C3MLS)
    *   Y-axis: "Total Footprint (mWh)" ranging from 0 to 14 mWh.
*   **Bars:** Each design (CCLS, CMLS, etc.) has two sets of paired bars, one for Version I and one for Version II. Each bar is further divided into two components:
    *   "Embodied Footprint": Represented by light blue bars with diagonal lines.
    *   "Operational Footprint": Represented by light green bars with dots. The embodied footprint is at the bottom and the operational footprint is stacked on top of the embodied footprint, visually representing the Total Footprint
*   **Labels:**  Numerical values are placed above each bar, indicating the total footprint in mWh.
*   **Legend:** Located at the top of the graph, clearly distinguishing the "Embodied" and "Operational" components for both Version I and Version II designs.

**Text within the Image**

*   **Title:** "Footprint Type" (Legend title)
*   **Axis Labels:**
    *   "Total Footprint (mWh)"
    *   "Design Name"
*   **Design Names:** "CCLS", "CMLS", "DSELS", "RSWCRLS", "LPSVTLS", "C3MLS"
*   **Footprint Type Labels (in the legend):** "Embodied (Version I)", "Operational (Version I)", "Embodied (Version II)", "Operational (Version II)"
*   **Data Values:** Numerical values above each bar, such as "7.998", "7.808", "10.174", "10.082", "1.388", "1.268", "1.114", "1.055", "2.777", "2.800", "1.911", "1.757"

**Context and Importance**

The image is labeled "Fig. 12. Operational footprint for Version I and II of CCLS, CMLS, DSELS, RSWCRLS, LPSVTLS, and C3MLS Subthreshold Levelshifters". However, the image shows the Total Footprint, not just the Operational footprint. The surrounding text explains that the researchers are investigating a sustainability evaluation and benchmarking paradigm for subthreshold level shifters (SLS) which are used in modern multi-voltage domain ICs.  The paper introduces a novel metric to assess the environmental impact of these designs, moving beyond just Power, Performance, and Area (PPA).

*   **Importance:** The graph provides a visual comparison of the total environmental footprint of different SLS designs, breaking it down into manufacturing (embodied) and operational aspects.  This allows designers to identify the most sustainable choices for a given application, considering the complete lifecycle impact.

*   **Key Findings (based on surrounding text):**
    *   The graph likely validates the framework's ability to analyze the combined effect of manufacturing and operational impact on sustainability.
    *   RSWCRLS has the least Total footprint among all SLS designs, making it the most sustainable option overall.
    *   The text mentions that CMLS had the least Embodied Footprint, but this graph (Fig. 13) shows CMLS having a high Total Footprint, meaning that it has a significant operational impact.
    *   Earlier in the document RSWCRLS was also listed as having the least operational footprint

In summary, this image (Figure 13) is crucial to the research because it quantifies the environmental impact of different level shifter designs and highlights the importance of considering both embodied and operational footprints in sustainability assessments. The text reinforces these observations, drawing conclusions about the sustainability of specific designs based on the data presented.
