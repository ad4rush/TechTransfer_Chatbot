ABSTRACT
Embedded memories occupy up to 70% of the area and account for 30-50% power
consumption in advanced digital SoCs. A large part of this power is leakage power.
Therefore,high-density,low-leakageSRAMcellsaredesirable. Weproposetwoasym-
metrical SRAM cells and benchmark with conventional 6T, 5T, and 4T SRAM cells.
The first SRAM cell is a 4TA asymmetrical SRAM cell. We designed it under iso-
stable constraints. We show that in a 130nm CMOS technology, the proposed 4TA cell
is denser by up to 7% than 6T SRAM cells and has about 4X lower leakage than 6T
SRAM cells. However, the performance is lower in 4TA as compared to 6T SRAM.
The second SRAM is a 5TA asymmetrical SRAM cell. We designed 5TA under iso-
area constraints. Our analysis shows that the proposed 5TA cell has about 10X and
6.23X lower leakage than the conventional SRAM cell in 130nm and 65nm CMOS
technology,respectivelyatasimilar performancepoint.

INTRODUCTION
1.1 Motivation
SRAM, or static random-access memory, is a type of nonvolatile memory that main-
tainsinformationaslongaspowerisapplied. SRAMisusedinSOCsascachememory
becauseSRAMhasafasterwrite/readaccesstimethanothertypesofmemory,increas-
ing the SOCs’s speed and performance. The performance of SOCs increases with the
expansion of SRAM capacity. However, both leakage and overall area increase. Con-
ventional six-transistor (6T) SRAM is the most commonly used SRAM and accounts
for up to 70% of the die area in modern SOCs [1], consumes a major share of leakage
duringstandbyperiods[2]andscalingof6TSRAMisnotpossiblebecausethestability
and performance of 6T SRAM reduces. These are the limitations of using 6T SRAM
in SOCs. This highlights the need for an SRAM design to minimize leakage and area
footprint andprovide highperformance.
1.2 SRAM Architecture
A memory array is made up of a 2-dimensional 2Mx2N array of memory cells, where
M and N represent the column and row address widths, respectively. Each cell stores a
single bit of data. To access the contents of the array, you need to assert the word lines
(WLs) of a particular row, which is referred to as the address. The data required by the
userisstoredinthebitcellsofthatrow.
AnSRAMarrayconsistsofmultiplecircuitsthatworksequentiallytoreadandstore
data. Figure 1.1 provides an overview of all the sub-circuits of the SRAM memory.
Hereisabriefexplanationofeachsub-circuit:
A bit-cell is used to store a single bit of data. A word line enables multiple words
of memory. Column decoders are used to select the addressed memory word. Column

multiplexers connect the BL and BLB of the selected columns to the sense amplifiers
to read the cell value. Write drivers are used to write into the memory cells. Row
decoders decode the address given to the memory and activate the corresponding row
ofthememoryarray.

Here's a thorough analysis of the image, based on the provided text and the image itself:

**Visual Elements and Their Structure:**

The image is a block diagram illustrating the architecture of a Static Random-Access Memory (SRAM). The key components shown and their arrangement are:

*   **SRAM Memory Array:** This is the central block. It represents the core of the memory, where data is stored.  It is visualized as a grid of "BitCell" blocks, arranged in a 2Mx2N array.  "BitCell" is written inside each memory block. The dashed lines connecting the bit cells signify the continuity of the array. The dimension labels "2N" (width) and "2M" (height) on top and left represent the number of columns and rows, respectively.
*   **Row Decoder:** Located to the left of the memory array. It selects a specific row (word line) in the array based on an address. It connects to the array via lines representing the word lines.
*   **Column Decoder:** Positioned below the row decoder.  Its function is to further refine which part of the memory the row decoder addresses by way of a MUX which is described next.
*   **Column MUX (Multiplexer):** This sits below the memory array. It selects specific columns to connect to the sense amplifiers, effectively choosing which bits from the selected row will be read. The mux switches are visually represented as transistor symbols.
*   **Sense Amplifiers:** Situated below the column MUX.  These amplify the weak signals from the memory cells during a read operation to provide a clear data output.
*   **Write Drivers:** Located below the sense amplifiers.  These provide the signal to write data into the selected memory cells during a write operation.
*   **Read-Write Control:** This block takes "Read Enable" as input and outputs "Sense En" and "Write En" signals, which control the read and write operations of the memory.

**Context and Importance:**

The image (Figure 1.1) is presented within the "SRAM Architecture" section (1.2) of the introduction to a research paper on SRAM. The preceding text establishes the motivation for the research:  SRAM is crucial for SOC performance but conventional 6T SRAM has limitations in terms of area, leakage, and scalability.  The figure provides a high-level overview of how an SRAM works. It shows the interplay of different components: the memory array, row and column decoders for addressing, multiplexers for column selection, sense amplifiers for reading, and write drivers for writing.

The text surrounding the image (from pages 11 and 12) explicitly describes the function of each sub-circuit: bit-cells store data, word lines enable memory words, column decoders select memory words, column multiplexers connect to sense amplifiers, write drivers write data, and row decoders activate rows.

The image's importance lies in:

*   **Providing a visual representation of the text description:**  It allows the reader to grasp the relationships between different SRAM components more easily than reading a purely textual description.
*   **Serving as a reference point for subsequent discussions:**  The figure likely forms the basis for further analysis and optimization of specific SRAM components in later chapters of the research paper. Subsequent chapters likely delve into the components shown in Figure 1.1 in greater detail. For instance, the following page (page 13) introduces the conventional 6T SRAM cell.

two access transistors, PG1 and PG2, control access to the cross-coupled inverters for
readandwriteoperations.

Here's a comprehensive analysis of the provided image, based on the text and surrounding context:

**Visual Elements and Structure:**

The image is a circuit diagram depicting a conventional 6T SRAM (Static Random-Access Memory) cell. It's composed of the following key elements:

*   **Two Cross-Coupled CMOS Inverters:** These form the core of the memory cell and are responsible for storing the data bit. Each inverter consists of a pull-up (PU) transistor and a pull-down (PD) transistor. Specifically, there are PU1, PD1, PU2, and PD2 transistors.
*   **Access Transistors:** Two access transistors (PG1 and PG2) are used to control access to the inverters for read and write operations.
*   **Bit Lines (BL and BLB):** Two bit lines, BL and BLB (BL bar), are used for reading and writing data to the cell. BLB is the complement of BL.
*   **Word Line (WL):** A single word line (WL) is used to activate the access transistors (PG1 and PG2) and enable the cell for read or write operations.
*   **Power Supply (Vdd) and Ground:** The diagram includes symbols for the power supply (Vdd) and ground, indicating the cell's power connections.

The inverters are cross-coupled, meaning the output of one inverter is connected to the input of the other. This creates a feedback loop that maintains the stored data. The access transistors connect the inverters to the bit lines when the word line is activated.

**Text Within the Image:**

*   **Vdd:** Indicates the positive power supply voltage.
*   **BL:** Bit Line
*   **BLB:** Bit Line Bar (complement of BL)
*   **WL:** Word Line
*   **PU1, PU2:** Labels for the Pull-Up transistors in the inverters.
*   **PD1, PD2:** Labels for the Pull-Down transistors in the inverters.
*   **PG1, PG2:** Labels for the Pass Gate (access) transistors.
*   **Q:** Denotes the output of one inverter, representing the stored data value.
*   **QB:** Denotes the output of the other inverter, representing the complement of the stored data value.

**Context and Importance:**

The image's context is within a literature review of SRAM technology, specifically the 6T SRAM cell. From the surrounding text:

*   The text introduces the 6T SRAM cell as a fundamental building block for memory.
*   The figure illustrates the architecture of this cell, which is responsible for storing a single bit of data.
*   The description of read and write operations in the text directly references the elements in the image, explaining how the transistors and bit lines are used to access and modify the stored data.
*   The text emphasizes the importance of proper sizing and stability for correct operation, hinting at the critical parameters that influence the cell's performance.

The figure is essential because it provides a visual representation of the abstract descriptions in the text. By examining the circuit diagram, the reader can understand the structure of the 6T SRAM cell, the role of each transistor, and how the bit lines and word line are used to interact with the memory cell. It is foundational for understanding the discussion of alternative SRAM designs like the 5T SRAM discussed later in the surrounding text, which are proposed due to the limitations of scaling down the 6T design.

Here's a detailed analysis of the image based on your request:

**Visual Elements and Structure:**

The image is a waveform diagram. Waveform diagrams are commonly used in electrical engineering and computer science to illustrate the changes in signal values over time. This diagram shows the signal behavior of a 6T SRAM (Static Random Access Memory) cell during different operations.

*   **Axes:** The horizontal axis represents time, segmented into different operating phases: "Reset," "Read," "Precharge," "Write," and "Precharge." The vertical axis represents signal amplitude, implicitly represented by high/low states or numerical values.
*   **Waveforms:** The diagram contains several waveforms, each representing a different signal within the SRAM cell:
    *   **WL (Word Line):** A pulse waveform that goes high during "Read" and "Write" operations.
    *   **BL (Bit Line):** Shows changes in voltage depending on the operation and data stored.
    *   **BLB (Bit Line Bar):** Complementary to BL, changes in the opposite direction during read and write.
    *   **Q:** Represents the data stored in the SRAM cell (the stored bit).
    *   **QB (Q Bar):** Represents the inverse of the data stored in the SRAM cell.

**Text Within the Image:**

*   **Labels (Horizontal Axis):**
    *   Reset
    *   Read
    *   Precharge
    *   Write
    *   Precharge
*   **Labels (Vertical Axis):**
    *   WL
    *   BL
    *   BLB
    *   Q
    *   QB
*   **Signal Values:**
    *   BL=1, BL=0
    *   BLB=1, BLB=0
    *   Q>0, Q=0, Q=1
    *   QB=1, QB=0

**Significance of Waveforms:**

*   **WL:** The word line is activated (goes high) during read and write operations to allow access to the SRAM cell.
*   **BL and BLB:** These bit lines are used to read data from and write data to the SRAM cell. During the "Read" operation, one bit line discharges (goes low) depending on the stored value at 'Q'. During the "Write" operation, the bit lines are driven to specific values (BL to the new data value, BLB to the complement), which then forces 'Q' to store the new value.
*   **Q and QB:** These represent the stored data and its complement. They change state during the write operation to reflect the new stored value. During the reset phase, Q starts with a value greater than 0 (Q>0) before stabilizing, indicating an initial state.

**Image Context and Importance:**

The image is labeled "Figure 2.2: 6TSRAM waveform". The surrounding text describes the operation of a 6T SRAM cell.

*   **Overall Context:** The image illustrates the behavior of a standard 6T SRAM cell during read and write operations. The waveforms show how the word line, bit lines, and internal nodes (Q and QB) change their states to perform read and write functions.
*   **Importance:** The figure is crucial for understanding how data is accessed and stored in a 6T SRAM cell. It visually represents the signal timing and voltage levels required for correct operation. The accompanying text explains how these signals interact during different operating modes, and is used by the authors as a baseline to build their work. The text and figure together help explain the limitations of the 6T SRAM and justify the introduction of the 5T SRAM for better scaling, even though the text also describes the limitations of the 5T SRAM cell and mentions write assist schemes.

**Summary:**

This figure provides a visual explanation of the operation of a 6T SRAM cell, covering the states of bitlines, wordlines, and internal nodes during read, write, reset, and precharge operations. The diagram is critical for understanding the functionality of the 6T SRAM cell, its limitations and why alternate SRAM designs are of interest to the authors of this paper.

Figure2.3: 5TSRAM
If ‘0’ is stored at Q then BL discharges through PG1 and PD1 then the bit lines act as
outputs, and a sense amplifier detects voltage changes on BL or BLB to determine the
storeddatavalueat‘Q’.
Write Operation As shown in Fig 2.4. During a write operation, a new data value
is supplied on the bit line BL. The word line is activated, enabling PG1, and the new
data will be stored at ‘Q’ in the SRAM cell, depending on the bit line value. However,
writing ‘1’ is not possible in 5T SRAM because, in 5T, there is no PG2, so during
writing ’1’ BL is set to VDD, the Q is initially at ’0’, and PD1 strength is more than
PG1,andQBisat’1’soPD1isalwaysonsoPD1dischargesthenodeQtotheground
and not allow the storing of ’1’, Write ’1’ is possible with a write assist scheme like
boosting wordlinevoltageorreducing thesupply voltageVDD.However,asshownin
Table 3.3, these techniques may result in reduced speed, increased memory area, and
increased write time and overall power. In this work, we use VDD lowering of 0.6V
and WL boosting of 0.3V to write ‘1’ in 5T SRAM at 130nm, and in 65nm a droop of
0.25V,andaWLboostof0.2Visused.

**Context and Importance**

The image is labeled as "Figure 2.3: 5TSRAM" and appears on page 5 of the research paper. This image serves as a visual representation of a conventional 5T SRAM cell, and is used to explain its operation. The text surrounding the image and in its caption describes how the cell stores data and how read and write operations are performed.

The surrounding text clarifies that the 5T SRAM cell is an alternative to the 6T SRAM cell, especially as technology scales down. Scaling 6T SRAM is difficult, while the 5T SRAM offers better density but has limitations in writing '1' without write-assist techniques. The text explains the need for write-assist schemes (like VDD lowering or WL boosting) to enable writing '1' in 5T SRAM, and the trade-offs associated with these techniques (reduced speed, increased area, and increased power). The text mentions that the 4T SRAM is proposed for future scaling of memories and to solve the 5T SRAM write problem.

Therefore, the image is important because it illustrates the fundamental structure of a 5T SRAM cell, which is a key component in memory design. The surrounding text describes the advantages and disadvantages of 5T SRAM compared to 6T SRAM, and the challenges associated with writing data to the cell. The image serves to explain this design alternative.

Here's a comprehensive analysis of the provided image and its context within the research paper:

**Visual Elements and Structure:**

*   **Type:** The image is a timing diagram or waveform. It illustrates the voltage levels of different signals in an SRAM cell over time during read and write operations.
*   **Axes:** The horizontal axis represents time, showing the sequence of operations like "Precharge," "Read1," "Write0," and "Write1."  The vertical axis implicitly represents voltage levels (high or low, represented by 1 or 0).
*   **Waveforms:** There are five waveforms, each representing a different signal within the SRAM cell:
    *   **WL (Word Line):** A control signal that activates the memory cell for read/write. The waveform shows pulses indicating when the cell is being accessed.
    *   **BL (Bit Line):** Carries the data during read and write operations. 'BL=1' indicates a high voltage (representing a '1'), and 'BL=0' indicates a low voltage (representing a '0').
    *   **Q:**  Represents the stored data at one of the storage nodes in the SRAM cell. 'Q=1' means the cell is storing a '1,' and 'Q=0' means it's storing a '0.'
    *   **QB:** Represents the complement of the stored data (the inverse of Q).
*   **Annotations:** The diagram includes labels above each operation phase (e.g., "Precharge," "Read1"). An important annotation is "Write 1 failure" with an arrow pointing to the Q waveform during the "Write1" operation.

**Text within the Image (OCR Extraction):**

*   **Labels (Above Waveforms):**
    *   Precharge
    *   Read1
    *   Write0
    *   Read0
    *   Write1
*   **Signal Values (Within Waveforms):**
    *   WL
    *   BL=1
    *   BL=0
    *   BL<1
    *   Q=1
    *   Q=0
    *   Q>0
    *   Q<1
    *   QB=0
    *   QB=1
*   **Annotation:**
    *   Write 1 failure (with an arrow)

**Significance of Visual Elements:**

*   The waveforms show the expected behavior during read and write operations for storing a '0' and a '1'.
*   The key observation is the "Write 1 failure." The waveform for Q during the "Write1" operation doesn't reach a full '1' level (it's labeled as "Q<1"). This indicates that the SRAM cell cannot reliably store a '1' using a standard write operation.
*   The diagram visually demonstrates the issue of writing '1' to a 5T SRAM cell.

**Context and Importance:**

*   **Image Label:** The image is labeled as "Figure 2.4: 5TSRAMwaveform".
*   **5T SRAM Issue:** The surrounding text describes the challenges of writing a '1' to a 5T SRAM cell.  Unlike a 6T SRAM cell, a 5T SRAM cell lacks a dedicated access transistor for one side of the bit cell. This asymmetry makes it difficult to reliably force the cell to store a '1' during a write operation. The waveform in Figure 2.4 provides a visual representation of this limitation.
*   **Write Assist Techniques:** The surrounding text also mentions "write assist" techniques (like boosting the word line voltage or reducing the supply voltage) to overcome the "Write 1 failure."

**Overall Importance:**

The image is crucial because:

1.  **Illustrates the Problem:** It provides a clear visual representation of the write '1' failure in 5T SRAM, a key limitation.
2.  **Contextualizes Research:** It justifies the need for the write assist techniques and/or alternative SRAM cell designs that the research paper may be exploring or proposing.
3.  **Links Theory and Practice:** It bridges the theoretical explanation of the 5T SRAM write issue with a simulated or measured waveform, making the problem more concrete.

**Context and Importance**

*   **Overall Context:** The image is part of a research paper investigating SRAM cell designs, likely comparing the performance characteristics of different SRAM architectures (e.g., 4T, 5T, and 6T). The 4T SRAM cell is being presented as one possible design for memory applications, especially in the context of scaling down memory sizes and addressing issues related to leakage, power, speed, and area. The image serves as a visual representation of the circuit being discussed.
*   **Significance:**
    *   The surrounding text indicates that 4T SRAM is being investigated as a potential solution to some of the limitations of other SRAM cells (like 6T) at smaller technology nodes (e.g., 130nm, 65nm).
    *   The text emphasizes the importance of the driver transistors (PD1 and PD2) for maintaining stability during the read operation.
    *   The document is attempting to improve on the 5T SRAM design, which can not store '1', and also attempting to improve on the 6T SRAM cell design, which can have high leakage and area. The 4T SRAM cell aims to solve these shortcomings.
*   **Relationship to Surrounding Text:** The figure is explicitly referred to in the text as "Fig. 2.5: 4TSRAM". The text then describes the basic structure of the 4T SRAM cell, referencing PD1, PD2, PG1, and PG2, directly corresponding to the labels in the image.
*   **Overall Purpose of Image:**
    *   To provide a clear visual understanding of the 4T SRAM cell structure.
    *   To facilitate the discussion of its operation (read and write operations) by providing a visual reference for the components being described.
    *   To serve as a basis for comparison with other SRAM cell designs discussed in the paper (e.g., 5T, 6T).

In a 130nm to maintain the iso stable read, the size of the driver transistors PD1
and PD2 must be larger than that of the 6T SRAM. As a result, there is up to an 11%

For the Iso area, 4T has a lower static read noise margin than 6T SRAM and up
to 2.5X and 1.58X higher leakage compared to the 6T SRAM in 130nm and 65nm
respectively. Therefore,thereisaneedforanefficientSRAMcellthathaslowerleakage

Here's an analysis of the image based on your provided text and the surrounding context:

**Image Analysis**

*   **Visual Elements:** The image is a waveform diagram. It shows the voltage levels of different signals within the 4T SRAM cell over time during various operations. There are six plots horizontally aligned and showing the variation of a few parameters as function of the time.

*   **Structure:** The diagram has a horizontal time axis implicitly divided into stages: "Reset", "Read", "Precharge", "Write", and "Precharge". Vertically, it displays the voltage levels of the following signals, arranged from top to bottom:
    *   WL (Word Line): Controls access to the SRAM cell.
    *   BL (Bit Line): One of the two bit lines used for reading and writing.
    *   BLB (Bit Line Bar): The complement of the Bit Line (BL).
    *   Q: The data stored in the SRAM cell.
    *   QB: The complement of the data stored in the SRAM cell.

*   **Text within the Image:**
    *   Labels above the time axis sections: "Reset", "Read", "Precharge", "Write", "Precharge"
    *   Signal labels on the left: "WL", "BL", "BLB", "Q", "QB"
    *   Voltage levels/Data values at various points:
        *   BL=1, BL=0, BLB=1, BLB=0, Q>0, Q=0, Q=1, QB=1, QB=0

*   **Signal behavior:** The image shows how the signals change their state over time. It shows the various operations of the 4T SRAM cell.
    *   The reset operation starts with setting WL to be high, bitlines (BL, BLB) to be 1, Q>0, and QB to be 1.
    *   During read, WL is high, BL goes to 0, BLB stays at 1, Q is 0, and QB is 1.
    *   During write, WL is high, BL is 1, BLB goes to 0, Q is 1, and QB is 0.
    *   The bit lines and the data values are pre-charged between read and write.

**Context and Importance**

*   **Overall Context:** The image, labeled as "Figure 2.6: 4TSRAMWaveform", illustrates the read and write operations of a 4T SRAM (Static Random-Access Memory) cell. This is a type of memory cell that uses four transistors to store a bit of data. The preceding figures (2.4 and 2.5) likely depict the 5T SRAM and the 4T SRAM cell structure respectively.

*   **Importance:** The waveform is crucial for understanding how the 4T SRAM cell functions. It visualizes the changes in voltage levels on the word line (WL), bit lines (BL, BLB), and the stored data (Q and QB) during read and write operations. By showing the timing and state transitions of these signals, the waveform enables researchers to analyze the cell's behavior, performance, and potential limitations.

*   **Significance Based on Text:** The surrounding text highlights the trade-offs of using a 4T SRAM cell compared to the more common 6T SRAM cell. While the 4T SRAM can be simpler, it has disadvantages like larger area, higher leakage current, and lower static read noise margin. The need for an efficient SRAM cell with lower leakage and maintained performance motivates the research presented in the paper. The waveform helps visualize these performance characteristics and provides a baseline for evaluating new SRAM cell designs. The waveform also helps understanding how the 4T SRAM's operations work. The description of the write and read operations in the text describe the functionality depicted in the figure.

Here's a detailed analysis of the image provided, based on the surrounding text and its visual elements:

**Overall Context and Importance:**

The image (Figure 3.1) is a schematic diagram of a proposed 4TA (4 Transistor Assist) SRAM cell, presented in Chapter 3 of a research paper focusing on memory SRAM cell design.  The surrounding text highlights the need for SRAM cells that offer lower leakage and higher density, a need driven by the drawbacks of existing SRAM cell designs (5T, 6T, etc.). The proposed 4TA SRAM cell aims to address these limitations. This image is crucial because it visually represents the architecture of the proposed solution, enabling readers to understand its key components and how they interact. The image, together with table 3.1 (mentioned in the text), and figures 3.2 and 3.3, is key to understanding this novel approach.

**Visual Elements and Structure:**

The image is a circuit diagram. It consists of the following key elements:

*   **Transistors:** The diagram shows several transistors represented using standard circuit symbols. NMOS transistors are represented by a line connected to a line with an arrow on it. PMOS transistors are shown with a circle connected to the gate of a transistor.

*   **Lines and Connections:** Lines represent electrical connections. Nodes within the circuit are clearly marked.

*   **Labels:** Labels are used to identify the key components and signals in the circuit.

*   **Enclosures**: The "Bit line suppression circuit" and "Write Assist circuit" are enclosed in a dashed line area for easy identification.

**Text within the Image:**

The following text is visible within the image (this is more precise than the original OCR):

*   **VDD:** Supply voltage.
*   **BL:** Bit Line.
*   **WL:** Word Line.
*   **Q, QB:** Output nodes of the SRAM cell (QB is Q bar - the inverse of Q).
*   **P:** Internal node within the write assist circuit.
*   **PG1:** PMOS Access Transistor 1.
*   **PD1, PD2:** NMOS Driver Transistors 1 and 2.
*   **PU2:** PMOS Load Transistor 2.
*   **M1, M2, M3, M4:** Transistors within the bit line suppression and write assist circuits.
*   **A:** Control signal for the write assist circuit.
*   **PR:** Signal related to the bit line suppression circuit.
*   **RW/H:** Read/Write-Hold signal for the bit line suppression circuit.
*   **Bit line suppression circuit:** Label for the bit line suppression section.
*   **Write Assist circuit:** Label for the write assist section.
*   **I/O region:** Label to signify where the bit line suppression and write assist circuits are.

**Significance of the Components and Circuits:**

*   **4TA SRAM Cell Core (PG1, PD1, PD2, PU2):** This is the core memory storage element. The arrangement of these transistors forms a latch that stores a single bit of information. The PMOS transistor PU2 acts as a load resistor to maintain a high voltage level when the transistor is in an OFF state. The access transistor PG1 controls access to the cell during read/write operations.

*   **Bit Line Suppression Circuit (M3, M4, PR, RW/H):** According to the text on page 9, this circuit reduces the voltage of the bit line (BL) in standby mode (VDD - VTM3) to lower the drain-source voltage (VDS) of PG1. This reduces leakage current through the access transistor when it is OFF.

*   **Write Assist Circuit (M1, M2, A):**  The write assist circuit is used to facilitate writing '1' to the cell.  As mentioned in the text, when writing '1', signal A is low, turning off M1 and enabling the diode-connected transistor M2 to set the node P voltage to VGSM2. This reduces the drain-source voltage (VDS) of PD1, weakening it, allowing PG1 to effectively write a '1' to the node Q.

**Overall Image Analysis:**

The image provides a clear schematic of the proposed 4TA SRAM cell, highlighting the core memory element, the bit line suppression circuit, and the write assist circuit. These two supporting circuits are crucial innovations to address the shortcomings of current SRAM cell designs. Understanding this schematic is paramount to grasping the proposed improvements of the 4TA cell (lower leakage and higher density), and for interpreting the results presented later in the paper.

During the standby operation, as shown in Fig. 3.3, the signal A is set to logic high,
which turns ON the transistor M1. As a result, the node P voltage is set to the ground

We characterized all the Figures of Merit (FOMs) of cells using 130 nm CMOS
technology. We ran Monte Carlo simulations (1,000 samples) to estimate FOMs and
computed all the FOMs on their Worst Process, Voltage, and Temperature (PVT). We

SNM is a measure of cell stability and ensures that memory content is not corrupted
during the memory operation. RSNM represents the maximum noise voltage that the
cross-coupled nodes can endure without causing the cell’s data to flip during a read
operation. Since all the cells were designed for iso-stable read, all cells have the same
RSNM,

Figure3.8: 32X324TAmemory arrayleakage
Leakage
Leakage is the current that flows when the cell is in hold mode. In our analysis, we
used battery life as the inverse of leakage. It is important to note that the leakage of
the 4TA SRAM is data-dependent, as shown in Fig. 3.8. When ‘0’ is stored at node Q,
then access transistor PG1 leaks lower because the bit line suppression circuit reduces
its drain-source voltage, and PD1 also leaks lower, but when ‘1’ is stored at Q, then
drivertransistorPD1leaksmorebecause,it’ssizein4TASRAMcellislargerthanthat
of6T,whichleadstomoreleakagebutsupplyleakageislowerin4TASRAMcellthan
6T due to fewer transistors. Therefore, When ‘0’ is stored at node Q, the leakage is
reduced up to 75%, 74%, and 90%, respectively, compared to conventional 6T, 5T, and
4TSRAMcells. However,when‘1’isstoredatnodeQ,theleakageinthe4TASRAM
cell is equivalent to that of the conventional 6T and 5T SRAM cell but 63% lower than
theconventional 4TSRAMcell.

SRAM,boththeaccesstransistoranddrivertransistorareNMOS,whichdischargesthe
node Q to write ‘0’. This leads to a 79% degradation in the Write Margin for writing
‘0’ in the 4TA SRAM cell compared to the 6T SRAM. Write ‘1’ is done through BL
via PG1 in the 4TA SRAM cell, while in the 6T SRAM, both PG1 and PU1 are used
for writing ‘1’. This results in a 65% degradation in Write Margin for write ‘1’ in the
4TASRAMcellcomparedtothe6TSRAM
CellCurrent
Cell current is the current that flows through the read transistor during the read opera-
tion. To measure it, the BL is precharged to the VDD, while the WL is set to 0V. The
current passing through the read transistor PG1 is then measured and presented as the
readcurrent. Duringthereadoperationinthe4TASRAMcell,theONresistanceofthe

thereby reducing the cell current through the access transistor (PG1). As a result, the

ComparisionOfFiguresOfMerit
Leakage
Leakage is the current that flows when the cell is in hold mode. In a 5TA SRAM, the
length of the access transistor is larger, and fewer transistors are used in 5TA, causing
lower leakage. We found that 5TA SRAM has 10X lower leakage in 130nm and 6.28X
lower leakage in 65nm than 6T SRAM. In our analysis, we used battery life as the
inverseofleakage.
CellCurrent
Cell current is the current that flows through the read transistor during the read oper-
ation. To measure it, the RBL is precharged to the VDD to measure the cell current,
whiletheWBLissetto0V.Thecurrentpassingthroughthereadtransistoristhenmea-
sured and presented as the read current. In a 5TA SRAM, the cell current depends on
the size of the PR1 transistor. Sizing up the PR1 transistor increases read current. For
5TA SRAM, the cell current is improved by 1.34X at 130nm and 1.27X at 65nm as
comparedtothe6TSRAM
Performance
Performance is directly proportional to the RBL/BL discharge rate. The RBL/BL dis-
chargerateiscomputedasthesingle-endedvoltagecreationrateontheRBL/BLduring
the read operation for 5TA. It is effectively the ratio of the RBL/BL discharge value to
the time it takes to discharge the RBL/BL by that value. The RBL/BL capacitance is
extracted for 64 rows to calculate the discharge rate. We found that the time to dis-
chargetheRBLislowerduetohighercellcurrent,causingtheperformancetoimprove

RSNM is a measure of cell stability and ensures that memory content is not corrupted
during the read operation. The proposed 5TA SRAM is a read-disturb-free SRAM
because 5TA has a decoupled read. and its RSNM is the same as the HSNM, which
is the maximum noise voltage that can be tolerated at the cross-coupled nodes during
standbymode.
Upon comparing HSNM, it can be observed that the HSNM of the proposed 5TA

WriteMargin
The write margin for the 5TA is defined as the maximum voltage of WL at which
new data can be written into the cell when bit-lines are precharged to VDD. In a 5TA
SRAM, during the write ‘1’ operation, the source of the driver transistor PD1 is not at
ground voltage, which prevents the driver transistor from discharging the internal not
to ground, causing write ‘1’ can be done easily through access transistor but 5TA has
higher sigma variation than 6T SRAM. In terms of u/σ, the write margin of the 5TA
SRAM is degraded by 1.46X at 130nm and improved by 2.67X at 65nm as compared
tothe6TSRAM.

Write Time is the time to write a ‘0’ and ‘1’ in a bit cell. In 5TA SRAM, we found

CHAPTER 4
Conclusion
In this work, we propose two asymmetric SRAM cell benchmarks with conventional
6T, 5T, and 4T SRAM cells. We show that the Iso-Stable read 4TA SRAM cell has
a higher density of 7% compared 6T SRAM cell, respectively. Additionally, the 4TA
SRAM cell has up to 4X lower leakage than conventional 6T, but the performance is
lower in the 4TA SRAM cell as compared to the 6T SRAM cell. Then, we designed
an Iso-Area 5TA SRAM cell in 130nm and 65nm CMOS technology. It has 10X lower
leakagethanthe6TSRAMcellin130nmand6.23Xlowerleakagethanthe6TSRAM
cellin65nmtechnology. Furthermore,the5TASRAMcellexhibitshighercellcurrent.
Hence, our results indicate that the Proposed 4TA SRAM cell is preferred to design
low leakage and denser memories. The proposed 5TA cell is the preferred choice for
designinglow-leakageandhigh-speedmemories.
